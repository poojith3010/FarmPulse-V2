PREFACE 
 
 
 The Indian Horticulture has grown expone ntially over the years and the fruits and 
vegetable production has surpassed the food grain production of the country and reached 
the all time high of 315 million tonnes during 2018-19 which is the second largest next to 
China.  Such a phenomenal achievement is  made possible amidst a bundle of constraints 
such as declining per capita arable land availa bility, occurrence of regular droughts, low soil 
organic carbon, multi-nutrient deficiencies besides people quitting farming.  
 
 The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, plays a role in developing 
improved crop varieties and hybrids in frui ts, vegetables, spices & plantation crops, 
medicinal crops besides flowers, technologies and farm mechanization. The varieties and 
technologies are well received by farmers across the country and TNAU serves as the torch 
bearer of cutting edge technologies like nanote chnologies for the preservation of fruits and 
vegetables. The technology package deserves continued revision and update to ensure 
recent technologies are infused for adoption. In this context, the TNAU under the dynamic 
leadership of the Vice Chancello r, Director of Research and other technical directors, the 
“Crop Production Guide (CPG) – Horticulture 2020 ” was updated and ready for 
adoption by the farmers of the State of Tamil Nadu.   
 
 The CPG - Horticulture 2020  carries  complete package of practices of crops 
including varieties / hybrids, management techniques & technologies, protected cultivation 
of crops, drip fertigation, nematode management, integrated weed management practices, 
technology capsule for pests and diseases management, labour saving farm machineries and 
post-harvest management practices.  
 
 I take this opportunity to thank the Vice Chancellor, Director of Horticulture and 
Plantation Crops, Director of Research, Dean (Horticulture) other Technical Directors and 
Department officials for their tireless efforts to bring out the document that serve as the 
base for the growth and developm ent of horticulture and allied sectors in the State of Tamil 
Nadu.

PREFACE 
 
 The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Co imbatore, is known for its innovation to 
develop crop varieties, technologies and farm implements to enhance farm productivity and 
profitability. The TNAU has a well articulated an d structured research framework to develop 
varieties and technologies to enable adoption by the farmers of the State. The growth of 
Horticulture in the State and the country has grown phenomenally increased that ensured 
nutritional security.   
 
 The Research Council, Annual Crop Scientists Meets and Scientific Workers 
Conference rigorously review and  scout for the varieties or technologies to be 
recommended for adoption by the farmers of the State. Such a meticulous planning and 
execution help us in assembling basket of vari eties and technologies that are packaged as 
the Crop Production Guide - Horticulture 2020. This covers the standard operational 
protocols for fruits, vegetables, spices & plantation crops, medicinal crops besides flowers 
with reference to varieties / hybrids, production technologies and farm mechanization. 
 
 The “ Crop Production Guide (CPG) – Horticulture 2020 ” was revised and 
updated involving the Directors and Deans in the university besides Department of 
Horticulture and Plantation Crops and Department officials. The Department and University 
is working very closely to resolve the unresolved field problems. Such network helped us to 
improve the CPG as a technology package suitable for the farmers of the Tamil Nadu State. 
 
 I take this opportunity to thank the Agricultural Production Commissioner & Principal 
Secretary to the Government, Director of Hort iculture and Plantation Crops, Director of 
Research, Dean (Horticulture), other Technical Directors, and Department officials for their 
contribution towards the publication of the CPG - Horticulture 2020.

Canopy management   
 Remove rootstock sprouts and low lying branches nearer to ground to facilitate easy 
cultural operations. Remove overlapping, intercrossing, diseased, dried and weak branches in 
old trees to get good sunlig ht and aeration.  Carry out judicious pruning of the internal 
branches during August – September, once in three years.  Do not allow flowering upto three 
years by removing the inflorescences as and when they appear.  Retain two healthy shoots 
by trimming a way the weak shoots among the crowded terminal shoots during August -
September annually. Prune back 20 cm of annual growth of the terminals immediately after 
harvest. 
 
Top working of senile orchards for rejuvenation  
Use scions of choice varieties like Alph onso and Banganapalli for top working. Behead 
the trees to be top worked during July - August leaving the main trunk at a convenient height 
and allow for new shoots to develop.  Adopt cleft method of grafting or softwood grafting on 
the emerging shoots from the cut end of the main stem during September- October. 
 
Growth regulators 
  Spray NAA @ 20 ppm at flowering to increase the fruit  set and  retention.  During 
February 0.5% Urea (5 g / lit.) or 1% Potassium nitrate (10 g / lit.) may be sprayed to induce 
flowering, if trees do not flower by that time. Spray 2% KNO 3 at mustard size to increase fruit 
size and retention of fruits. Spray 2 % sulphate of potash at pea stage and 15 days after to 
improve yield and quality.    
During off year Paclobutrazol @ 0.75 g a.i. per metre of canopy radius in full bearing 
tree during first fortnight of September to get maximum number of fruits and yield. 
 
Off-season crop induction 
 This technology is recommended only for irrigated conditions to shift production from 
on- season to off - season. To induce off -season flowering , heading back of 10 cm terminal 
growth after the emergence of new growth (vegetative and f loral growth) during December -
January along with soil application of Paclobutrazol @ 0.75g  a.i. per tree during Marc h - April 
is recommended for mango cv.Neelum. Keeping good soil moisture conditions and nutrient 
health status of the plant are very important when Pacloburazol application is resorted.

Selection and pre-treatment of suckers  
  Select sword suckers of 1.5 to 2.0 kg weight, free from diseases and nematodes.   
Trim the roots and decayed portion of the corm, cut the pseudostem leaving 20 cm from 
the corm and grade the suckers to size. To avoid wilt disease, infected  portions of the corm 
may be pared, dipped for 5 minutes in carbendazim 0.1% (1 g in 1 lit of water) for Rasthali, 
Monthan, Neyvannan, Virupakshi and other wilt susceptible varieties. Pralinage  with 40 g of 
carbofuran 3CG granules per sucker (Dip the corm in slurry solution of 4 parts clay plus 5 parts 
water and sprinkle carbofuran to control nematodes). Sow sunhemp on 45th day; incorporate 
it after about a month. This operation reduces nematode build up. Use well hardened  tissue 
cultured banana plants with 5-6 leaves. At the time of planting, apply 25 g Pseudomonas 
fluorescens / plant.

    days from planting and then twice with cowpea for  30days  
 
Aftercultivation   
Garden Land 
  Give spade digging at bi-monthly intervals and earth up. Prune the suckers at monthly 
intervals. The dry and diseased leaves are removed and burnt to control  the spread of leaf 
       
10 
 
spot diseases. Male flowers may be removed a week after opening of last hand. The plants at 
flowering may be propped. Cover the peduncle with flag leaf to prevent stalk end rot. Cover 
the bunches with banana leaves to avoid sun scald. 
 
Wet land 
  Form trenches in between alternate rows and cross trenches at every 5th  row.  The 
trenches are periodically deepened and the soil is spread over the bed. Surface diggings may 
be given at bi-monthly intervals and desuckering at monthly intervals. Remove the male flower 
a week after opening of last hand. Prop plants at or prior to flowering. Cover the peduncle with 
flag leaf and the bunch with leaves to avoid sun scald.  For ratoon crops, in respect of 
Poovan, Monthan and Rasthali, allow the follower at flowering of the mother plant and remove 
the other suckers at harvest. 
 
Perennial banana 
  Give surface digging with spade once in two months.  Give one deep digging with 
spade during January – February. Other operations as in garden land. 
 
Hill banana 
  Give four forkings in January, April, July and October.  Remove outer sheaths to keep 
the corm inside the soil and ward-off borer. Maintain two bearing plants and two followers per 
clump along the contour. 
 
Growth regulators 
  To improve the grade of bunches, 2,4-D at 25 ppm (25 mg / l.) may be sprayed in 
Poovan and CO 1 banana after the last hand has opened.  This will also help to remove 
seediness in Poovan variety. Spray CCC 1000 ppm at 4th and 6th month after planting. 
Spray Plantozyme @ 2ml / l at 6th and 8th month after planting to get higher yield. 
 
Micronutrients 
  Spray micronutrients viz., ZnSO4   (0.5%), FeSO4   (1.0%), CuSO4   (0.2%) and 
H3BO3   (0.2%) at 3rd, 5th and 7th MAP to increase yield and quality of banana. Apply 25 kg 
ZnSO4 basally. 
 
Bunch cover 
  Use transparent recyclable polyethylene sleeves with 2% (during cool season) and 4% 
(during summer season) ventilation to cover the bunches immediately after opening of the last 
hand  
 
Intercropping 
  Leguminous vegetables, beetroot, elephant foot yam and sunnhemp. Avoid growing 
cucurbitaceous vegetables. 
 
Special Practices 
 Mulching with 100µm degradable polythene sheet immediately after  planting conserves soil 
moisture and also suppresses weed growth. Surface digging and earthing up of soil at bi -monthly 
intervals facilitates better root system. Desuckering should be done at monthly intervals. Removal 
of dried leaves at periodical interv als reduces the disease spread.  At the time of bunch 
emergence, prop the plants using bamboo or casuarina poles.  After the completion of female 
phase, remove the male bud for better fruit development. After opening of the last hand, withered 
styles and perianth to be removed to avoid finger tip disease. 
 Bunch thinning i.e., removal of one to two small bottom hands from the bunch (keeping only 7 to 8 
hands) facilitates uniform bunch development and this practice is recommended for export 
purpose. Cover the  peduncle with flag leaf to prevent main stalk end rot.  Cover the bunch with 
degradable polythene sleeves (2 - 4 % ventilation) or with white colour non -woven UV stabilized 
       
11 
 
polypropylene sleeves to avoid sunscald and to produce quality bunch. After harves ting, the 
pseudostem should be cut leaving a stump of about 0.6m height to nourish the developing 
daughter sucker.

Bunchy-top 
 
 The Banana Aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa is the vector of 
Bunchy-top virus disease.  
 The spray may be directed towards the crown and pseudostem 
base upto ground level at 21 days interval at least thrice. 
To prevent the disease, 
i) Use virus-free suckers 
ii) Paring and pralinage :  Pare the corm and  sprinkle 40 g of 
carbofuran 3 G over the corm (Before sprinkling, corm should 
be dipped in mud slurry). 
iii) Destroy virus affected plants.

Diseases  
Selection and pre-treatment of suckers  
 Select sword suckers of 1.5 to 2.0 kg weight, free from diseases and nematodes. Trim 
the roots and decayed portion of the corm, cut the pseudostem leaving 20 cm from the 
corm and grade the suckers to size. To avoid wilt disease, infected portions of t he 
corm may be pared, dipped for 5 minutes in carbendazim 0.1% solution (1 g in 1 l of 
water) solution for Rasthali, Monthan, Neyvannan, Virupakshi and other wilt 
susceptible varieties. 
 Pralinage with 40 g of carbofuran 3 CG granules per sucker (dip the co rm in slurry 
solution of 4 parts clay plus 5 parts water and sprinkle carbofuran to control 
nematodes).  
 Sow sunnhemp on 45th day; incorporate it after about a month. This operation reduces 
nematode build up.

+ trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 300 g/ha 
 
 
Panama Disease (Fusarium wilt) 
 Uproot and destroy severely affected plants 
 Apply lime at 1 – 2 kg in the pits after removal of the affected plants 
 Corm injection : Remove a small portion of soil to expose the upper portion of the 
corm. Make an oblique hole at 45° angle to a depth of 10 cm. Immediately insert a 
gelatin capsule containing 60 mg of carbendazim or of 50 mg of Pseudomonas 
fluorescens or inject 3 ml of 2 % carbendazim solution into the hole with the help of 
‗corm injector‘ on 2nd, 4th and 6th months after planting 
 Apply press mud at 5 kg per plant  to reduce the wilt incidence or apply                               
Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf1) liquid formulation @ 4 l/ha at 2 nd, 4th and 6th months 
after planting through drip system to manage panama wilt and nematode complex. 
 
Cigar end rot 
 CIB recommendation: Spray mancozeb 75% WP @1.5-2.0 kg/ha 
 
Bunchy-top 
 Use virus-free suckers for planting 
 The banana aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa is the vector of bunchy-top virus disease 
 Destroy virus affected plants  by inserting a gelatin capsule containing 200 mg 2,4 - D 
into the corm 7 cm deep using capsule applicator or inject 5 ml 2,4 - D solution (125 
gm/lit of water) into the pseudostem by using the injection gun. The plant collapses and 
topples in 3 – 5 days 
 Apply carbofuran 3 G @ 166 g /plant or spray dimethoate 30EC @ 1 ml/l or m ethyl

Varieties: PKM 1, VRM 1 Tahithi lime, Balaji (Tenali), Vikram, Rasraj, NRCC -7, NRCC -8 , 
Phule Sharbathi 
 
Soil and Climate: Areas with dry climate and moderate rainfall ( <750 mm) are best suited. 
Deep well drained m edium black, loamy or alluvial soils rich in organic matter and devoid of 
calcium carbonate are good. The optimum pH is 6.5 -7.0 
 
Season: December – February and June – September. 
 
Propagation:  Budded plants on Rough lemon or Rangpur lime rootstocks are good. Since 
seeds are highly polyembryonic and seedlings are true to type, propagation by seeds is also 
recommended. Layering is adopted for VRM 1 Tahithi lime. 
 
Planting: Healthy seedlings are planted during June to December at 6 x 6 m spacing in 75 
cm x 75 cm x 75 cm pits. 
 
Irrigation: Young plants need regular watering during post -monsoon period at an interval of 
8-10 days and at 5 -7 days during summer months. Water is applied around the periphery of 
the tree in a ring and basin system (double ring) so that tree trunk should not come in direct 
contact with water. Avoid water stagnation. Adopt drip system for new plantations. 
 
Manures and Fertilizer s per plant: ‘ N‘ to be applied in two doses during March and 
October.FYM, P2O5 and K2O are to be applied in October. Pseudomonas @ 20 g and VAM 
@ 200 g per plant may be added along with FYM application.

After cultivation: Remove branches of main stem up to 45 cm from ground level. Periodical 
removal of dried twigs along with one inch length of basal green wood and destroying them 
by  
burning should be done. Spray Zinc sulphate @ 0.5% (500 g /100 lit of water) thrice in a 
year (March, July and October) after the emergence of new flushes. 
The basins should be mulched with dry leaf waste or paddy husk with about 10 cm thickness 
so as to arrest weed growth and also to conserve soil moisture, thereby improving the fruit 
quality. 
 
Intercropping: Legumes and vegetable crops can be raised during pre-bearing age. 
 
Growth regulator: To increase fruit set, spray 2, 4 – D @ 20 ppm (200 mg / 10 l) during 
flowering. For fruit retention, spray 2, 4 – D @ 20 ppm or NAA 30 ppm (300 mg / l) after fruit 
set (marble size). 
 
Harvest: Starts bearing from 3 - 4 years after planting. The tree  flowers and produces fruits 
almost all the year round, but there are three major flushes in June -July (Mrig Bahar), 
September-October (Hast Bahar) and January – February (Ambi Bahar). Fruits of 
September-October flowering (Hast Bahar) harvested during summer months are most 
remunerative. The fruits mature in 5 -6 months after flowering and are harvested when the

colour just start s changing. Peak harvesting period is July -September and November -
January. 
Post harvest handling  
Harvested fruits are graded according to size and colour and packed  in bamboo baskets or 
wooden crates lined with green foliage. Treating the fruits with 4% wax emulsion followed by 
pre-packing in 200 gauge polythene bags with 1 % ventilation improves the shelf life for 
more than 10 days.

4.  Sweet Orange (Citrus sinensis (L) Osbeck) ; Rutaceae 
Varieties : Sathugudi, Batavian, Mosambi, Malta blood red, Cutter Valencia. 
 
Soil and Climate 
Deep well drained loamy soils are the best for the cultivation of Citrus. pH of soil 
should be 6.5 to 7.5 and EC of water less than 1.0. A dry climate with about 5 0 – 75 cm of 
rainfall from June – September and with well defined summer and winter season is ideal.  
 
Season : July to September. 
 
Planting material 
Budded plants (Roots tock: Rangpur lime is the best, now rough lemon is also 
preferred). 
 
Preparation of field 
Dig pits at 75 cm x 75 cm x 75 cm in size at 7 x 7 m spacing. Fill up the pits with top 
soil and 10 kg of FYM. Plant the budded plants in the centre of the pits and stake it.  Plants 
should be trained during first 3 years to have a well distributed fram e work at 45 cm height 
on a single trunk. 
 
Irrigation 
Immediately after planting, irrigate copiously and continued once in 10 days. Irrigations 
should be regular during fruit development. Avoid water stagnation near the plant.  Water 
should never come in di rect contact with the trunk of the tree; for this reason, double ring or 
check bund method is best suited for this crop. Drip irrigation is advisable in saving of 
irrigation water. Stopping irrigation 1 or 2 months prior to flowering is beneficial

and Iron per tree per year. 
 
After cultivation 
No regular pruning except removing dead, diseased and over crowding branches after 
harvesting of the fruit. The basins should be mulched with dry leaf waste or paddy husk with 
about 10 cm thickness so as to arrest weed growth and also to conserve soil moisture, 
thereby improving the fruit quality. 
 
Intercropping: Legumes and vegetable crops can be raised during pre-bearing age. 
 
Harvest: Starts bearing from 5th year after planting.  Sweet orange takes 9 -12 months for 
maturity. Being non-climacteric fruits should be harvested only after full maturity.

Soil and Climate  
Grapes prefer dry humid condition for better growth and yield. Areas within the 
temperature range of 15 to 40 oC and rainfall lies between 500 and 900 mm are suitable for 
this crop. Rain should not coincide with vine growt h after pruning and bunch ripening phase. 
Cloudy weather with high relative humidity, fog and low temperature are not suitable for 
flowering and fruit set. This results in build up of fungal diseases which ultimately leads to 
loss in yield.  
Well-drained rich loamy soil with a pH of 6.5 - 7.0 with low water table with EC less than 
1.0 is congenial for its cultivation. The soil depth  should be atleast 1 m for proper root 
development and vine establishment. The rootstocks viz., Dogridge and 110 R can be used to 
overcome the high soil pH, drought and salinity in irrigation water with EC upto 8 m.mhos 
cm2.  The day time temperature ranging from 20oC to 35oC is optimum for proper vine growth 
and establishment. 
 
Field preparation and Planting  
The grapevine can be trained over pandal system or improved ‗‘Y‘‘ trellis training 
system. ‗‘Y‘‘ trellis system facilitates mechanization inside the grape vineyard for ploughing, 
bed formation, interploughing and tractor mounted spray of plant protection chemicals, foliar 
nutrients and plant growth regulators.  
The dogridge rootstocks or own rooted cutting of varieties are used as planting 
materials for the establishment of grape vineyards. Trenches of 2.5 ft depth and 2.5 ft width 
has to be opened in North -South direction base d on the field length to get proper root zone 
development. This helps in harvest of maximum sunlight for photosynthesis and fruit bud 
differentiation. Fill the trenches with top soil, FYM, sheep manure, green manure, super 
phosphate etc., and irrigate copi ously. This should be done one month prior to the planting of 
rootstocks or rooted cuttings. The best time for planting rootstocks in the field is during 
       
21 
 
January - February. The rootstock after planting in the soil requires regular irrigation at 
periodical interval in its field capacity. In light textured soils, the rootstocks should be irrigated 
daily. There is no fertilizer requirement upto one month after planting since the roots are not 
active and require some time for settling. The rootstock plant once  settled in the soil should 
be allowed to grow as such till 50 days from the planting time. The number of shoots sprouted 
from each plant helps in increasing the root density. These plants are cut back from the base. 
One month after sprouting, the plants s hould be retained with 2 -3 healthy disease free and 
vigorous shoots. These shoots are tied with bamboo or casuarina poles with the help of korai 
fibre or jute thread. On 5 -6 months old grown up rootstocks , in situ grafting is done with the 
scion sticks with 2-3 healthy buds  of 15-25 cm length. The in situ grafting can be performed 
during June to September .  The rootstocks are decapitated at 1.5 feet height from the ground 
level before grafting. At the time of grafting, temperature of 32 -35OC and high relativ e 
humidity of 80 per cent in the atmosphere and rootstocks with high sap flow are preferred for 
getting high graft take. Simple wedge grating is the best method for in situ grating for getting 
maximum success for the establishment of grapes vines. Whereas the best time for planting 
the own rooted cuttings is June-July. 
Spacing  
Spacing interval of 4 x 2 m for commercial grape  varieties and 3 x 2 m for Muscat 
Hamburg. 
 
Irrigation   
Irrigate immediately after planting and on the 3rd day and then once in a week. Withheld 
irrigation 15 days before pruning and also 15 days before harvest.

 Training  
 Once new shoots are started from the scion portion after grafting or from the own 
rooted cuttings, train the shoots straight by tying them to bamboo sticks or casuarina poles. 
The girth of  the graft union tend to increase during the graft growth, during this time the 
polythene strips have to be removed to avoid the girdling damage or constriction over the main 
stem. For getting uniformity in growth of grapevines by giving recut at 3 rd node position above 
the graft joint. Immediately after the recut, faster sprouting will be notice d and this needs 
proper management for the cordon developme nt by adopting ‗‘Halt and Go‘‘ method. The 
growth is nipped of one f eet below the level of pandal or ‗‘Y‘‘ trellis and then  trained to form 
trunk, primary and secondary arm (cordon) of the grapevine. In this method, the newly growing 
shoots are cut at 6 -7 leaf stage when the growth attains 8 -9 leaf. Th e vines are trained with 
single stem upto pandal with a stalk on tipping at 2 m height. The main arms are developed and 
trained on opposite directions. On further tipping, secondary and tertiary arms are developed 
for spreading all over pandal.

Pruning  
In general, four bud level of pruning for Pachadraksha, Bangalore Blue, Anab- e-Shahi, 
Dil Kush and Arka hybrids, five bud level for Red Globe, five to seven bud level for Muscat 
Hamburg and two bud level for S harad Seedless, Thompson Seedless and its clones (After 
sub cane formation at 7 th  node) may be adopted. Before pruning , the pruning severity 
and bud level can be determined by bud forecasting technique. Canes of weak and immature 
nature should be pruned back to one or two buds to induce vegetative growth. 
 
Pruning Season 
Summer crop: Pruning in December - January and harvesting during April - May. 
Winter crop: Pruning in May-June and harvesting during August - September  
 
Double pruning for double cropping in Muscat Hamburg (Panneer) 
For getting high yield with quality fruits, adoption of double pruning and double 
cropping system is the best for Muscat Hamburg (Panneer). The first pruning for getting 
summer crop can be practiced during December  - January and harvesting is made during in 
April - May. T he second pruning can be practis ed during May -June and harvesting during 
August - September. The vines are allowed for 2 -3 months period of rest after harvesting till 
December. Apart from Muscat Hamburg, the vari eties like Anab -e-Shahi, Clone A -18/3, 
Manjari Medika and H -516 are also highly suitable for adoption of double pruning for double 
cropping. 
 
Double pruning for single cropping in commercial grapes varieties  
For commercial grapes varieties viz., Red Globe, Thompson Seedless and its clones, 
Crimson Seedless, F lame Seedless, Fantasy Seedless and  Sharad Seedless , adoption of 
double pruning for single cropping is the best practice for harvesting good quality fruits with 
high yield. The first pruning (Back prun ing) is done at one to two bud level during August - 
September and allowed for vegetative growth. The second pruning is done on grown up vines 
(Forward or fruit pruning) during January -March and harvesting is made from May -August 
depending on the duration of varieties for attaining maturity. For example, the grapes variety 
Sharad Seedless matures in 100 to 110 days, whereas the Crimson Seedless takes 150 days 
for maturity.  
 
Manures and Fertilizers (kg per vine) 
Seedless grapes varieties  
Requirement of nut rients for the grapevine is influenced by variety, age of the 
grapevine, soil, climatic behaviour and irrigation water quality. Nutrient application based on 
soil, water and petiole analysis will be appropriate and reduces unwanted / excess use of 
fertilizers. Excess nitrogen is responsible for vegetative growth and restricts the flower bud 
formation, number of bunches and yield. High phosphorus is directly useful for flower bud 
initiation and differentiation. The cane maturity is hastened by the applicatio n of potash which 
in turns responsible for flowering and bunch quality.  
Recommended nutrient dose of fertilizers for grapes varieties viz., Thompson Seedless 
and its clones and Sharad Seedless should be applied 2 feet away from the main trunk base 
in trenches or in rings of 3-4 inch depth for better absorption.

Muscat Hamburg (Panneer) 
Immediately after harvesting, the vines are allowed for short term rest for a period of 15 
days. During this period, irrigation and fertilizer application should be followed for recouping 
the vines. A trench of 3 to 4 inch depth with 2 feet width between two vine s should be opened 
and 500 g single superphosphate and 25 kg FYM should be applied in the trenches. The 
trench should be covered with the soil and earthing up is done for the formation of more white 
absorbent roots.

Special viticultural practices  
Shoot thinning  
There will be lot of new shoots of more than 100 at faster rate after pruning from the 
buds of vines. More number of shoots will result in overcrowding which compete for nut rients 
and water and prone for pest and disease incidence with poor productivity. For growing the 
seedless varieties for export , less than 0.75 shoot, domestic market purpose 1 shoot and for 
Muscat Hamburg (Panneer) 2 shoots per square feet area should be retained. Shoot thinning 
should be practised at 4-5 leaf stage.  
 
Sub cane development  
Commercial seedless grapes varieties with high vigour require sub cane development 
to achieve high degree of fruitfulness. The vines supplied with high nitrogenous fert ilizers and 
more irrigation also result into vigorous vegetative growth. To avoid the faster vegetative 
growth, the shoots are pinched at particular node position. Then the lateral is allowed to take 
lead with slow growth with short internodes at base. Thi s practice is known as sub cane 
development.  
 
Training the shoots  
To ensure proper micro climate inside the canopy the growing shoots are trained at 
proper distance in the ‗‘Y‘‘ trellis or pandal. Training the shoots will be helpful for light 
penetration and proper aeration to trigger the uniform cane maturity and also to avoid the pest 
and disease incidence.    
 
Tipping  
Tipping is practised by the retention of 9 -11 leaves above the last cluster and tying of 
clusters in the pandal after the fruit set for  berry development and maturity in the bunches. 
Further tendrils are also removed.  
 
Nipping  
Nipping is practised by removing the emerged shoots from axillary buds and terminal 
growth at 12th to 15th bud position from the base.  
 
Cluster and berry thinning  
Thinning of excess number of clusters prior to anthesis and thinning  the compact 
bunches by removing 20 - 30 per cent of the berries at pea stage (3-4 mm size berries) using 
hand scissors should be followed . Dip the clusters in solution containing Brassinosteroid 0.5 
ppm and GA3 25 ppm at 10-12 days after  fruit set to maintain vigour, yield and quality 
parameters.

lime solution constantly stirring the mixture. Earthern or wooden vessels and plastic containers 
alone should be used and metall ic containers should not be used. To find out whether the 
mixture is in correct proportion, a polished knife should be dipped in the mixture for one minute 
       
27 
 
and taken out. If there is reddish brown deposit of copper, additional quantity of lime should be 
added till there is no deposit in the knife. 
Quality improvement in Muscat Hamburg  
To get uniform ripening in Muscat, spray the bunches with 0.2% Potassium chloride  
(2 g /l) at 20 th day after berry set , followed by another spray on 40 th day. Dip the clusters of 
Thompson seedless and other seedless varieties at calyptra fall stage with 25 ppm GA (25 
mg / l) and repeat again at pepper stage to increase the size of berries. 
Retention of 9 leaves above the last cluster with the foliar application of 10 ppm GA 3 
when the berries at parrot green stage and 0.5 ppm of homobrassinolide was found to be the 
best for high yield and quality. 
Foliar application of chelated EDTA c alcium @ 0.2 % combined with boric acid @ 0.1 
% during early berry development was highly effec tive for getting high yield and for reducing 
berry cracking.  
Quality improvement in seedless grapes varieties  
Extensive u se of various plant growth hormones in seedless commercial grapes 
varieties is very common for enhancing the yield land quality. But one should be very careful 
about the stage of use and the concentration of these hormones. Gibberellic acid (GA 3) 
application reduces number of flowers and also results in elongation of berries and bunches. 
Plant growth regulators like Brassinolide, Benzyl  Amino Purine (6 -BAP) and CPPU increase 
the size of berries. The schedule and the concentration of different hormones for balanced 
crop, quality bunches and berries in seedless grape varieties  
Days after pruning Stage of bunch Hormone Concentration 
(ppm)

  Use of GA 3 during cloudy weather should be avoided. This results in excess flower 
dropping and reduces the fruit set. Likewise GA 3 should not be used during full bloom stage to 
fruit set period. To ensure better results for GA 3 on berry size and el ongation, may be applied 
by spraying or dipping bunches.

Crop Regulation  - Bahar Treatment 
 There are three distinct flowering seasons with corresponding harvest ing periods -rainy, 
winter and spring. It is desirable to take only one crop in a year.  
 In South India the rainy season crop is preferred even though it is of poor quality, since the 
price is high at this time.  
 Guava is a current season bearer. Inducing f lowering or bahar treatment in guava includes 
management practices like withholding of water, irrigation, fertilization and use of growth 
regulators in association with pruning technique.

Papain extraction 
  Papain has several industrial uses, the important one being in brewing industries.  
It is used as ―meat tenderiser‖ and in textile and leather ―sanforization‖ processes and  
drugs.The method of extraction of papain from papaya fruits is simple.  The latex should be 
tapped from immature papaya fruits. Select 75 to 90 days old fruits. On the selected fruit, give 
incisions (cut) with a razor blade or stainless steel knife. The cuts should be given from stalk to 
tip of the fruit.  The depth of the cut should not be more than 0.3 cm.  Four such cuts are 
given spaced equally on the fruit surface.  Tap the latex early in the morning and complete the 
tapping before 10.00  A.M. Repeat the tapping four times on the same fruit at an interval of 
three days. The cut should be given on the fruit surface in places not covered by previous cuts. 
The latex collected from all the plants in a day should be pooled, shade dried in an aluminium 
pan or tray and passed through  a 50 mesh sieve to remove all foreign matter. In large 
       
35 
 
plantations, vacuum driers can be  adopted with advantage.  Papain produced by artificial 
heating will have better colour and high quality.  Add Potassium meta-bi-sulphite (KMS) at 
0.5 % for better colour and keeping quality. 
The latex should be dried very rapidly at temperatures of 50 to 55oC. Stop drying 
when the dried product comes off as flakes having a porous texture. Powder the dried papain 
by means of  wooden mallets or in electrically operated  granulators and sieve the powder 
through 10 mesh sieve.  Pack the powder in polythene bags in convenient quantities and 
seal them.  Put the sealed bags in a tin container and seal it after evacuating air. Exposure 
to air deteriorates the quality of papain and vacuum sealing is therefore necessary.  For large 
scale manufacture of papain,  vacuum sealing machine and a granulator will be useful.The 
green papaya fruits after extraction of papain can be used for pectin manufacture and ―tuity 
fruity‖ or they can be allowed to ripen and made into other products.  The CO 2, CO 5 and 
CO 8 varieties  of papaya released by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore are 
ideal for papain production.  
 
Yield 
  The yield of crude papain is as follows: CO 2: 600 kg / ha, CO 5 & CO 8: 800 kg / ha. 
 
Seed Technology 
 
Germination improvement 
  Store the seeds in airtight containers.  Soak the seeds in 100 ppm GA3 for 16 
hours or in 2% fresh leaf extract of arappu or 1% pungam leaf extract or pellet the seeds with 
arappu leaf powder. 
 
Optimum depth of sowing 
  Sow seeds at 1 cm depth for better germination and seedling growth. 
 
Grading 
  BSS 6 wire mesh sieve. 
 
Storage 
 Dry seeds to 8-10% moisture and treat with halogen mixture containing CaOCl2, CaCO3 
and arappu leaf powder (at 5:4:1 ratio) @ 3 g / kg and pack in cloth bag to maintain viability upto 
5 months. 
 
Invigoration of old seeds 
 Stored seeds can be invigorated by soaking them in dilute solution of disodium 
phosphate (10-4 M) adopting 1:8 seed to solution ratio for 4 hours, followed by drying back to 
original moisture content.

Soil and Climate 
      It is grown in a wide range of soils; drought resistant a nd tolerant to salinity and alkalinit y. 
Cool winter and dry summer are necessary for  production of high quality fruits.It performs 
well up to1800m elevation. 
 
Planting 
 Rooted cuttings or layers of 12 to18 months age can be planted during June to 
December in pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm at 2.5 to 3 m spacing either way. 
 
Propagation 
  Hardwood cutting of 15 cm length and 6 mm thickness. Pre -treat with Carbendazim 
(0.1%) + Bactronol (2 –Bromo, 2- Nitropropane, 1-3 diol) @ 0.05% for 10 minutes , followed by 
one washing with tap water and dipping the lower half of the cuttings for 5 minutes in 2000 
ppm IBA. Maintain 85% relative humidity 
 
Flower regulation 
  NAA 10 mg/l as foliar spray  during September when new flush initiation occurs.

Training and pruning 
  Fruits are borne terminally on shoot s emerging from mature wood. To promote new 
shoots on all sides , annual pruning is done after harvest is completed during December by 
shortening of past season shoot by removing one third of the shoot. Besides, dried, disease 
affected, criss -cross branches and root suckers/ water sprouts are removed. The plant is 
trained to get a single stem up to 60 cm with 3 or 4 scaffold branches.  
 
Other practices 
 Thinning of flower clusters ensures better size of the fruit.  
 Spraying liquid paraffin at 1%concentration at 15days interval twice during June 
reduces fruit cracking.  
 
Crop Regulation  - Bahar Treatment 
 Pomegranate flowers continuously when watered regularly. The plants under such 
conditions may conti nue bearing flowers and bear small crop irregularly at different period of 
       
37 
 
the year, which may not be desirable commercially. To avoid this trees are given bahar 
treatment. In this treatment, the irrigation is withheld two months prior to the bahar followe d by 
light earthing up in the basin. This facilitates the shedding of leaves. The trees are then 
medium pruned 40 -45 days after withholding irrigation. The recommended doses of fertilizers 
are applied immediately after pruning and irrigation is resumed. This leads to profuse flowering 
and fruiting. The fruits are ready for harvest 4-5 months after flowering.  
 
 In tropical condition, there are three flowering seasons, viz., January -February (ambia 
bahar) June -July (mrig bahar) and September -October (hasta bahar). The choice of 
flowering/fruiting is regulated taking into consideration the availability of irrigation water, 
market demand and pest/disease incidence in a given locality.

      The avoid can be taken depending on water availability, peat and disease i ncidence and 
market demand.  Ambe Bahar is most commonly preferred by the growers because of high 
yield as compared to other flowering season.  
 
Process of bahar treatment 
 Irrigation is withheld two months prior to the bahar. In case of light sandy and sha llow 
soils, withhold water for 4 –5 weeks.  Such results in water stress, leaves show wilting and 
fall on the ground 
 Application of ethrel spray at 2 to 2.5 ml/l mixed with 5 g/l of DAP  
  The trees medium pruned 40-45 days after withholding irrigation  
 Cover the roots with a mixture of soil and FYM and give light irrigation

Fruit Borer 
 
 Remove calyx to discourage egg laying wherever possible 
 Cover fruits with neem oil dipped cloth bags during flowering 
period to prevent egg-laying. 
 Spray neem oil 3 % or NSKE 5% or spinosad @ 0.4 ml/lit at 
the time of butterfly activity.  
 When the fruits are in marble stage, release Trichogramma 
chilonis @ 1 lakh/acre

Nematode management 
 
The propagating materials such as ground layers, grafts, rootstocks used for grafting, 
clones and rooted cuttings infested with root knot nematode, M.incognita in pomegranate act 
as sour ces for dissemination of these nematodes into main field. Use of air layers and 
sterilized soil media or adopting soil less media (vermiculite and coir pith) can keep the 
nematodes from entering the root system at nursery stage.

Gamboge is 
characterized 
by yellow 
exudation of 
gum on the 
fruits and 
branches by 
direct sun light. 
• Fruit splitting 
results in 
swollen arils 
with a mushy 
pulp.. Heavy 
and continuous 
rains during fruit 
ripening favour 
fruit splitting.

May - June and November - December 
 
Nursery bed preparation 
Apply FYM 10 kg, Neemcake 1 kg, VAM 50 g, enriched Superphosphate 100 g and 
Furandon 10 g per square metre before sowing.  
Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10g/m2 
Seed rate     
  Varieties :  300-350 g / ha 
  Hybrids :  100-150 g / ha 
 
Seed treatment 
Treat the seeds with Trichoderma viride 4 g or Pseudomonas fluorescens 10 g  or 
Carbendazim 2 g per kg of seeds 24 hours before sowing. Just before sowing, treat the 
seeds with Azospirillum @ 40 g / 400 g of seeds. Sow in lines at 10 cm apart in raised 
nursery beds and cover with sand. 
 
Protected nursery      
 Prepare the nursery area of 3 cents with slanting slope of 2 % for  the seedling 
production to cover 1 ha.  
 Cover the nursery area with 50 % shade net and cover the sides using 40/50 mesh 
insect proof nylon net.  
 Form raised beds of 1 m width and convenient length and place HDPV pipes at 2m 
interval for further protection with polythene sheets during rainy months.  
 Mix sterilized cocopeat @ 300 kg with 5 kg neem cake along with Azospirillum and 
Phosphobacteria each @ 1 kg. Approximately 1.2 kg of cocopeat is required for filling 
one protray. 238 protrays (98 cells) are req uired for the production of 23,334 
seedlings, which are required for one hectare adopting a spacing of 90 x 60 x 60 cm 
in paired row system.  
 Sow the treated seeds in protrays @ one seed per cell. 
 Cover the seed s with cocopeat and keep the trays one above the other and cover 
with a polythene sheet till germination starts 
 After six days, place the protrays with germinated seeds individually on the raised 
beds inside the shade net  
 Water with rosecan everyday and drench with NPK 19:19:19 @ 0.5% (5g/l) at 18 
days after sowing

Field preparation  
 Plough the land to fine tilth. Thoroughly prepare the field with the addition of FYM @ 
25 t/ ha and form ridges and furrows at a spacing of 60 cm. Apply 2 kg/ha of Azospirillum 
and 2 kg/ha of Phosphobacteria by mixi ng with 50 kg of FYM. Irrigate the furrows and 
transplant 25 days old seedlings on the sides of  ridges. Life irrigation to be given on 3 rd day 
of planting.

First ratoon crop can be retained for four months. The fertilizer dose of 100:150:200 
kg NPK / ha has to be applied for ratoon crop. In the same manner second ratoon crop can 
also be raised. The crop can be retained for 6 months and afte r that ratooned by cutting 
back of main branches to 20 cm height from the base.  
 
Yield 
The yield for hybrids in the main crop will be 70 t/ ha. First ratoon crop will be 45 t/ha 
and second ratoon crop will be 40 tonnes/ ha by adopting this technology.

Season and sowing 
July and January. Sow the seeds (3 seeds/pit) treated with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g 
or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g or carbendazim @ 2 g/kg of seeds and thin the 
seedlings to two per pit after 15 days. 
 
Seed rate 
Variety: 2.2 kg/ha and hybrid: 1.5 kg/ha. 
 
Preparation of field 
Plough the field to fine tilth. Dig pits of 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm size at 2 x 1.5 m 
spacing and form basins. 
 
Irrigation 
Irrigate the basins before dibbling the seeds and thereafter once in a week.

Quality seedling production 
Bitter gourd is a direct sown vegetable but polythene bag nursery is more 
advantageous to get early marketing and to avoid more gap filling. Use 200 gauge poly bags 
of 10 cm diameter x 10 cm height for sowing the seeds. Transp lant about 15 days old 
seedlings to the main field. 
 
Drip irrigation  
Install drip system with main and sub -main pipes and place the inline lateral tubes at 
an interval of 1.5m. Place the drippers in lateral tubes at an interval of 60 cm and 50 cm 
spacing with 4LPH and 3.5 LPH capacities respectively. 
 
Field preparation 
Form the rai sed beds of 120cm width  and spread the lateral tubes in the centre of 
each bed. Irrigation is done in the beds by operating the drip system continuously for 8 -12 
hrs. Spray pre e mergence herbicide like Pendimethalin @ 1 Kg a.i/ha just before planting. 
Planting or sowing is done at the holes made at 2 m distance.

14.  Gherkin (Cucumis sativus var. anguria);  Cucurbitaceae 
 
Soil :   Well-drained sandy loam with a pH range of 6.0 to 6.8 is optimum. 
Seed rate :  800 g per hectare. 
 
Sowing : Sow the seeds at 30 cm spacing on sides of the ridges with 2 seeds per hill after 
treating with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g or Pseudomonas @ 10 g or carbendizim @ 2 g/kg of 
seeds. 
 
Preparatory cultivation  :  Apply 25 t/ha of FYM. Prepare ridges and furrows one metre 
apart. 
 
Manuring :   Apply N - 150 kg, P - 75 kg and K - 100 kg/ha in 3 equal splits i.e., basal, 
three and five weeks after sowing. 
 
After cultivation :   Earth up the plants 25 days after sowing. Provide support to plants as 
and when vines start trailing. 
 
Drip irrigation 
  Install drip system with main and sub-main pipes and place the inline lateral tubes at 
an interval of 1.5m. Place the drippers in  lateral tubes at an interval of 60 cm and 50 cm 
spacing with 4 LPH and 3.5 LPH capacities respectively. 
 
Field preparation  :  Raise beds of 120 cm width at an interval of 30 cm and place the 
laterals at the centre of each bed.  
 
Fertigation 
  Apply the re commended dose of fertilizers viz., 150:75:100 Kg NPK / ha through 
fertigation on every third day after sowing. 
 
Plant protection 
Pests Control measure 
Leaf miner, white fly, aphids and thrips Spray  Dimethoate 1.5 ml/lit. or Malathion 1.5 ml/l. 
 
Diseases : Spray carbendazim @ 0.05 % to control fungal diseases 
 
Harvest 
  The crop is ready for harvest in 30-35 days.  As the tender immature fruits are meant 
for canning the price of the produce is decided by the stage of maturity. Smallest fruit (stage 
1) wh ich will weigh approximately 4.0g (250 fruits per kg) will fetch the maximum price 
followed by stage 2 and stage 3.  To maintain the grade , the harvesting of fruits should be 
done every day.  A day‘s break would end up with outsized or overgrown gherkin means loss 
to farmer. Avoid sharp sun and high temperature while harvesting. For this picking of fruits 
must be none in the very early morning or late evening. Harvest the fruits by retaining the 
stalk on the plant.  Harvested fruits must be collected under shade. Flower head has to be 
removed from fruit. Water should not be sprinkled on harvested fruits at any stage.  Even if 
there is surface water during harvest it should be dried by aeration. For collection of fruits 
jute bags alone have to be used and pla stic bags should be totally avoided. The harvested 
produce should be transported to the factory on the same day before dusk. Leaving the 
gherkin unprocessed overnight would result in poor quality produce. 
 
Yield :  10 - 12 tonnes/ha in 90 days.

Spodoptera frugiperda – New invasive pest 
Good Agricultural practices for management of Spodoptera frugiperda 
a) Deep Ploughing in order to expose the pupae of FAW to sun light and avian 
predators thereby curtailing the chance of emergence of next brood of FAW and 
occurrence of FAW for the next season. 
b) Application of neem cake @ 250 kg per ha in soil at the time of ploughing  to reduce 
the emergence of adults from pupae. 
c) Seed treatment with Beauveria bassiana 10 gram per kg of seed (or) imidacloprid 70 
WS (or) thiamethoxam 70 WS @ 10 gram per kg of seed. 
d) Adopt a spacing of 60 x 25 cm for irrigated maize and 45 x 20 cm for rainfed maize. 
Closer planting always facilitates for quick movement or spread of the larvae in 
between plants 
e) Leave rogue spacing of 75 cm for every 10 rows of maize mainly to facilitate easy 
spraying duri ng cob formation stage and to minimize FAW damage during cob 
formation and cob maturity stages 
       
118 
 
f) Use solar light trap / battery chargeable light trap / ordinary electric light fitted over a 
wide pot or bowel containing kerosene mixed water @ 2 -3 no. per hectare at random 
places in the length and breadth of the field. This can be shifted to various places in 
the field in rotation to monitor / mass trap the adults. 
g) Cultivation of short duration varieties of cowpea, sunfl ower, gingelly, sorghum and 
mari gold as border crop to attract, conserve and enhance the activity of natural 
enemies like parasitoids and predators  
h) Manual collection and destruction of egg mass and various stages of larvae of FAW 
from early stages of crop to reduce the population build up of the pest. 
i) Conservation of existing natural enemies like dragon flies, damsel flies, green lace 
wing flies, and lady bird beetles by avoiding non-recommended insecticides, incorrect 
method of application of insecticides, excess dosage of insecticides, and mix ture of 
pesticides. 
j) Application of Metarrhizium @ 1 Kg per hectare (or) 1 litre per hectare 
k) Apply Metarrhizium anisopliae  formulation @ 4 kg /ha (1x10 8 CfUs/gm) or 3 litre/ha 
((1x109 CfUs/gm) or  Need based spraying of azardirachtin 1 EC  - 2 ml per litre

 Spray mancozeb @ 2 g/l or carbendazim @ 1 g/l 
 
Leaf blight 
 Spray mancozeb @ 2.5 g/ l 
 
Physiological disorders 
 
Browning or brown rot 
  This is caused by boron deficiency. It appears as water soaked  areas and later 
change into rusty brown. Spray one kg of borax in 500 l of water 30 days after planting. 
 
Whip tail 
 This results from the deficiency of molybdenum. It is more pronounced in acidic soil. 
The leaf blades do not develop properly. In severe cases, only the midrib develops and it 
can be corrected by spraying 100 g of Sodium molybdate in 500 l of water 30 days after 
planting. 
 
Buttoning 
  The term buttoning is applied to the development of small curds or buttons. The 
plants do not develop normally and leaves remain small and do n ot cover the developing 
curds. Deficiency of nitrogen and planting the early varieties late may cause these 
symptoms. Avoid transplanting of aged seedlings. 
 
Blindness 
  Blind-cauliflower plants are those without terminal buds. The leaves are large, thick,  
leathery and dark green. It is due to the prevalence of low temperature when the plants are 
young or due to damage to the terminal bud during handling the plants or due to injury by 
pests.

 Spray Fluchloralin 1 l a.i./ha immediately after sowing the seeds to control weeds or 
first weeding to be done on 15th day. Thinning and earthing up should be given on 30th day. 
Splitting of roots is a physiological dis order which is usually seen when there is a 
sudden increase in soil moisture after prolonged drought. Forking is another phenomenon 
where in the hard soil does not allow the straight growth of tap root which results in formation 
of forked root. Forked root s and split roots fetch poor price in market. Keeping the soil 
moisture at optimum condition will help to keep the soil also loose thereby help to avoid 
splits and forked roots.  
 
Plant protection: Carrot is not much affected by pests.

Drip irrigation  
Install drip system with main and sub-main and place the inline laterals at the interval 
of 1.5 m. Place the drippers at the interval of 60 cm for 4 LPH and 50 cm for 3.5 LPH in the 
lateral system. Form the raised beds at 120 cm width at an interval of 30cm and place the 
laterals  at the centre of each bed. 
 
Sequential cropping 
  Raise CO 2 vegetable cowpea during March and harvest green pods before planting 
cassava during June –July. After green pod harvest, incorporate the cowpea haulms into the 
field by disc ploughing. Through sequential cropping, 50% reduction in application of FYM 
(12.5 t/ha) and P (30 kg/ha) is ensured.  
 
Manuring 
Irrigated crop 
 Apply 25 t FYM/ha and incorporate at the time of planting. Apply 45:90:120 kg

7. Elephant foot yam ( Amorphophallus campanulatus Blume); syn: (A. 
paeoniifolius); Araceae 
 
Varieties 
 Gajendra, Sree Padma 
 
Soil and climate 
 Rich red -loamy soil with a pH range of 5.5 -7.0 is preferred. It is a tropical and 
subtropical crop. It thrives well with a mean annual temperature of 30 -350C. It requires well 
distributed rainfall of 1000 -1500 mm spread over a period of 6 -8 months, with humid and 
warm weather during vegetative phas e and with cool and dry weather during the corm 
development period. 
 
 
Season and planting 
  It undergoes a dormancy period of 45 to 60 days. Traditionally farmers take 
advantage of the dormancy period by planting during February-March so that the setts would 
sprout with the pre-monsoon showers. April – May is the planting season. 
  
        The tuber is cut into 750 -1000g small bits in such a way that each bit has atleast a 
small portion of the ring around each bud. Whole corms of 500 g size can also be used  as a 
planting material. Use of cormels and minisett transplants of 100 g size as planting material 
at a closer spacing of 45 x 30 cm is also suggested.  There are also projections with tender 
buds called  ―Arumbu‖. These are removed before planting as the y do not give vigorous 
growth. 
 
 An ordinary sized yam gives about 6 to 8 bits for planting. The cut pieces are dipped 
in cow dung solution to prevent evaporation of moisture from cut surface. In some places, 
the small round daughter corms are also planted . The cut pieces are planted in beds at 45 
cm x 90 cm spacing or pit of 60 x 60 x 45 cm size is dug and planted. The pit should be filled 
with top soil and farm yard manure (2kg/pit) prior to planting. The pieces are planted in such 
a way that the sproutin g region (the ring) is kept above the soil. About 3500 kg of corms will 
be required to plant one hectare. Sprouting takes place in about a month. 
 
 
Preparation of field 
  The land is brought to fine tilth and beds of convenient size are formed. 
 
 
Intercropping 
  Vegetable cowpea var. CO 2 is recommended as suitable intercrop in elephant foot 
yam. It can be intercropped profitably in coconut, arecanut, rubber, banana and robusta 
coffee plantations at a spacing of 90 x 90 cm. Half quantity of FYM (12.5 t/ha) and one third 
of NPK (27:20:33) will be sufficient for the intercrop. 
 
 
Irrigation 
  It is mostly raised as a rainfed crop. However, irrigation is required when monsoon 
fails, where it is grown on a large scale. Water stagnation is harmful to the crop. Whe rever 
irrigation facility is available, irrigation can be given once a week. 
 
Mulching 
  Mulching immediately after planting not only conserves soil moisture and regulates 
soil temperature but also suppresses weed growth.  
 
 
 
       
144 
 
Application of fertilizers 
  Apply 25 tonnes of FYM/ha during last ploughing. The recommended dose of 
NPK/ha is 80:60:100 kg. Apply  40:60:50 kg NPK/ha at 45 days after planting along with 
weeding and intercultural operations. Top dress with 40:50 N and K one month later along 
with shallow intercultural operations. 
 
After cultivation 
  Weeding and earthing up as and when necessary. 
 
Diseases 
Collar rot  
  The disease is caused by a soil borne fungus Schlerotium rolfsii. Water logging, poor 
drainage and mechanical injury at collar region  favour the disease incidence. Brownish 
lesions first occur on collar regions, which spreads to the entire pseudostem and cause 
complete yellowing of the plant. In severe case, the plant collapses leading to complete crop 
loss. 
 
Management 
 Use disease fre e planting material, remove infected plant materials, improve 
drainage conditions, incorporate organic amendments like neem cake, drench the soil with 
carbendazim (1g/l of water) . or apply biocontrol agents like Trichoderma harzianum @ 2.5 
kg/ha mixed with 50 kg of  FYM.  
 
Harvesting 
  It becomes ready to harvest in about 8 -9 months after planting. The crop attains 
maturity when total senescence takes place.  
 
Yield 
  30 – 35 t/ha in 240 days. 
For seed purpose, the yams can be left in the field itself till planting the next crop or the lifted 
yams can be stored in sand or paddy straw.

Varieties 
  CO 1, Panchamukhi and Satamukhi (Kovvur), Sree Pallavi, Sree Rashmi, Sree 
Kiran. 
 
 
Soil and climate 
  It comes u p well in loamy soils with a pH range of 5.5 -7.0 and a combination of 
warm and moist climate with a mean temperature of 21 -270 C. It can be grown up to 1500 m 
elevation with well distributed rainfall of about 1000 mm during growth period. In areas 
where rainfall is less, a good amount of supplementary irrigation is required for successful 
production.   
 
 
Planting material and seed rate 
  Cormels weighing about 20-25 g form good planting material. Seed rate of 800 kg/ha 
is required. 
 
 
Season 
 Under rainfed c ondition, planting during April - June is ideal.  June – July and 
February – March is ideal. If grown as irrigated crop, it can be raised throughout the year. 
 
Preparation of field 
  Plough the field to a fine tilth and form ridges and furrows at a spacing of 45 cm. In 
sandy loam soil, pit method is followed. Plant at a spacing of 45 cm in furrows. The cormels 
may be planted to a depth of 2.5 to 7.5 cm. 
 
 
Mulching 
 Planted seed tubers take 30  to 45 days for sprouting. Mulching helps to hasten 
sprouting and control weed growth. 
 
Gap filling 
 Under field condt ions, 5-10 per cent of the seed tubers  fail to sprout. To overcome 
this situation, about 2000-3000 corms / cormels per hectare may be planted in a nursery at a 
close spacing so that sprouted tubers from the nursery can be used for gap filling. 
 
 
Irrigation 
 Once in a week. 
 
 
Application of fertilizers 
  Apply 25 tonnes of FYM, 20 kg N, 30 kg P and 60 kg K/ha as basal and 20 kg N, 30 
kg P and 60 kg K/ha 45 days after planting. 
 
 
After cultivation 
  Weeding a nd earthing up should be done 45 to 60 days after planting. Deep 
cultivation should be avoided. Small inefficient suckers from the mother plants have to be 
removed along with the second weeding. It requires profuse irrigation and shade.

Leaf blight (Phytophthora colocasiae): 
  Oval or irregular purplish or brownish necrotic lesions with watersoaked periphery 
appear on leaves. In severe cases, the entire leaf lamina and the petioles are affected giving 
a blighted appearance and collapse of the plant. Heavy incidence causes up to 50 per cent 
crop loss. 
 
Management  
  Use of field resistant varieties viz., Muktakeshi and Ja nkhri, early planting to avoid 
heavy monsoon rains, use of healthy planting materials, removal of self -grown colocasia 
plants, spray with fungicides viz., Mancozeb (0.2%) or metalaxyl+ mancozeb  @ 2 g/l of 
water and treating the seed tubers with biocontrol agents viz., Trichoderma viride 
 
 
Harvesting 
 Crop will be ready for harvest in 6 -8 months after planting. One month prior to 
harvest, all the suckers may be wrapped around the base of the mother plant and covered 
with soil by earthing up, for arresting fu rther vegetative growth and sprouting of tubers. After 
this, irrigation has to be withheld to hasten maturity. Harvesting is done by carefully 
uprooting the plants and the mother corms and cormels are separated. 
 
Yield 
 8 – 10 t/ha in 180 days.

Soil and climate 
 It requires warm and humid conditions with a mean temperature of 30 0C and a well 
distributed annual rainfall of 1200 -2000 mm. Sandy loam soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.5 is 
preferred with good drainage and cool weather. 
 
 
Season and planting :  March - June. 
 
Greater yeam:  Use mature tubers or pie ces of 250 -300 g tubers taken from the previous 
crop as seed material at the rate of 1875 – 2500 kg/ha. Mini setts of 25 g are recommended 
for planting directly in the field or raising a nursery and planting plants after 60 days.  
 
Lesser yam: medium sized tuber of 100 -150 g is sufficient. Planting is done in beds or in 
ridges or in mounds or in rows 75 cm apart either way. 
 
 
Preparation of field  : Plough the field to a fine tilth and form ridges and furrows at 75 cm 
spacing for raising lesser yam. Ridges a nd furrows at 75 cm spacing  or pits of 45 x 45 x 45 
cm for planting greater yam at 90 x 90 cm. Fill the pits with top soil and FYM. 
 
 
       
147 
 
Method of planting  : To plant greater yam, 3 ,000-3,700 kg and for lesser yam 1800 -2700 
kg of seed material is required. 
 
 
Irrigation :  Copious watering once in a week is necessary. 
 
Application of fertilizers 
  Apply FYM @ 25 t/ha at the time of last ploughing. Follow fertilizer schedule of 
40:60:120 kg NPK/ha as basal and 4 kg/ha of Azospirillum (mixed with 40 kg of soil) 30 days 
after planting. Apply 50 kg N and 120 kg K/ha 90 days after planting. Go for weeding before 
top dressing, followed by earthing up.   
 
After cultivation 
  The vines should be trained on bamboo poles. Weeding has to be done as and 
when necessary. It can be intercropped profitably in coconut, arecanut, rubber, banana and 
robusta coffee plantations at a spacing of 90 x 90 cm. In Robusta banana + Dioscorea 
system, banana should be manured at the full recommended dosage and for yams, 
manuring at the 2/3rd recommended level is sufficient. 
 
Trailing 
 Trailing is necessary to expose the leaves to sunlight. It is done within 15 days after 
sprouting by coir rope attached to artificial supports in the open area or to the trees where it 
is raised as an intercrop. 
 
Crop protection 
 Yam scale is found to occur on the tubers both under field and storage conditions. 
Use scale free seed tuber for planting. 
 
Harvesting 
 Greater yam and white yam become ready for harvest by 9 -10 months after planting. 
Lesser yam takes 8 -9 months for attaining maturity. Carefully dig out the tubers without 
causing injury. 
 
Yield :  20 – 25 t/ha in 240 days. 
 
 
 
10. Chinese potato  (Coleus parviflorus L.; Syn : Solenostemon 
rotundifolius); Labiatae 
 
Varieties 
  CO 1, Sree Dhara. 
 
Soil and climate 
  Red, loamy and well drained soils. Comes up well in shade with warm humid 
climate. It requires very good rainfall for its growth and cannot withstand drought conditions. 
In case rains are not received, irrigation has to be provided for satisfactory growth. 
 
Raising nursery 
  Raise a nursery, approximately one and half months prior to planting. An area of 500 
m2 is required to produce vines for planting one hectare of land. Cattle manure or compost 
may be applied @ 1 kg/m 2 and ridges / mounds may be p repared at a closer spacing of 
45/60 cm. Healthy tubers that weigh about 15 -20 g may be planted at 5cm spacing on the 
ridges / mounds so as to accommodate 750 -1200 kg tubers in 500 m 2 area during March - 
April. Top-dress with urea (5 kg / 500 m 2) at about t hree weeks after planting to encourage 
good vine growth. Stem cutting of 15 -20cm length from these sprouts also used as planting 
       
148 
 
material. To enable rapid multiplication of the planting material, single node cuttings can be 
planted directly in the secondar y nursery. Such single node cuttings produce axillary shoots 
within one week which  can be planted in the main field.  
 
Preparation of main field and planting 
  The field is ploughed 4 to 5 times to a fine tilth and form ridges and  furrows 60 cm 
apart. Use herbaceous cuttings of 10 cm length taken from the nursery beds and plant in the 
main field during July – October at a spacing of 30 cm on the ridges either in vertical or 
horizontal position. Horizontal planting of vines to a depth of 4 -5 cm and exposin g the 
terminal bud ensures quick establishment and promote tuber yield. In loose soils having 
good drainage, planting can also be done on flat beds with provision for drainage. 
 
Irrigation 
  At weekly intervals. 
 
Application of fertilizers 
  FYM at 25 t/ha  as basal and NPK at 30:60:150 kg/ha. Apply 30 kg N 30 days after 
planting at the time of earthing up along with 2 kg of Azospirillum. In case, the soil has 
eroded from the base of the plant, give one more earthing up at 30 days later to promote 
tuber formation. 
 
After cultivation 
  2 or 3 weedings and earthing up 2 months after planting. 
 
Crop protection  
Leaf folding caterpillars and vine borers   
 Dipping the vines in insecticide solution (Dimethoate @ 1.7 ml/litre) for 10 minutes 
prior to planting is he lpful. In case, severe damage is noticed in the field, field spraying may 
be adopted with Malathion. 
 
Harvesting 
  Harvest the crop when the vines dry up at 4 -5 months after planting. Pull out the 
plants and dig out the left over tubers in the field. Separ ate the tubers from the plant and 
destroy the crop residues by burning.  
 
Yield 
  15 to 20 t/ha in 120 days.

1. Onion - Small onion (Aggregatum) ( Allium cepa var. aggregatum); 
Alliaceae 
 
Varieties 
  CO 1, CO 2, CO 3, CO 4 and MDU 1, CO (On) 5 is a free flowering and seed setting 
type. 
 
Soil 
  Red loam to black soils with good drainage facilities  are ideal. The germination and 
bulb maturation are affected in clayey soil. It grows well in pH range of 6 - 7 and a mild 
season without extremes of heat and cold. 
 
Season and sowing 
  Plant the medium sized bulbs during April – May and October – November. It 
requires sufficient soil moisture during its growing period but heavy rains during bulb 
sprouting and bulb formation affects the crop growth. 
 
Seed rate 
  Seed bulbs 1000 kg/ha. Medium sized bulbs are to be chosen for planting. Seeds @ 
2.5 kg/ha. 
 
Raising seedlings and transplanting 
This is the most common method practised for irrigated crop as it results in high yield 
and large size bulbs.  In plains, seeds are sown during October-November for a rabi crop.  In 
hills, seeds are sown from March to June.  Seeds are first sown in well prepared nursery 
beds of 90-120 cm width, 7.5-10.0 cm height and convenient length.  Ratio between nu rsery 
area a nd main field is about 1:20. Seedlings of 15 cm height and  
0.8 cm neck diameter are ideal for transplanting and this is achieved in 8 weeks.  However, it 
varies from 6-10 weeks depending on soil, climate and receipt of rain.  There is a practi ce of 
topping seedlings at the time of transplanting if seedlings are over-grown. 
 
Preparation of field 
 Plough the land four times to a fine tilth. Form ridges and furrows at 45 cm spacing. 
Plant the bulbs or seedlings on both the sides of the ridges at 10 cm apart. 
 
Irrigation 
  Irrigate at the time of planting of seedlings and third day and later at weekly 
intervals. Withhold irrigation 10 days before harvest. 
 
Application of fertilizers 
  Apply FYM 25 t/ha, Azospirillum 2 kg and Phosphobacteria 2 kg/ha, N 30 kg, P 60 
kg and K 30 kg/ha as basal and 30 kg N/ha on 30th day of sowing. 
 
 Apply 25 kg ZnS O4, 2.50 kg CuSO4, 30kg S, and 25 kg MnSO4 /ha as soil 
application, if the soil is deficient in respective micronutrients. 
 Foliar spraying of 0.5% ZnSO4, 1% MnSO4 thrice on 30, 40 & 50 days after sowing. 
 
Fertigation  
  Apply a dose of 75% of the total recommended dose of superphosphate i.e. 285 
kg/ha as basal dose. Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria each @ 2 Kg/ha along with FYM 50 
Kg and Neem cake @ 100 kg are ap plied before last ploughing. Raised beds of 120 cm are 
formed at an interval of 30 cm and the laterals are placed at the centre of each bed.

Planting design 
Bulbs or seedlings are planted in rows of 20 cm spacing and 12 cm between plants. Planting 
is do ne at 6 rows in each bed, thereby it accommodates 55,560 plants in one hectare. 
Irrigation is done after transplanting or planting the bulbs. Complete wetting is necessary to 
maintain uniform moisture level.

Big onion and aggregatum onion production through fertigation 
 
Quality seedling production: 
 The seedlings of big / common bellary onion are produced in raised nursery beds. 
Nursery area of 12.5 cents with slanting slope of 2% is required for the seedl ing 
production to cover 1 ha. 
 For open / protected nursery, raised beds may be used , since  the seeds are too 
small and the number of seedlings required is  very high. 
 Raised beds of 30  cm height and convenient length at an interval of 30cm between 
beds must be formed for sowing the seeds. 
 The beds are inoculated with Arbuscular mycorrhizae @ 1 kg / sq. m. 
 
Seed treatment and seed rate: 
 2.5 kg of onion seeds are required to raise seedlings for one hectare of land.  The 
seeds are treated with Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10g/ kg of seeds. 
 
Sowing : 
 The seeds of onion are small, and hence the seeds should be mixed with fine sand 
and sown in lines 10 cm apart. 
 After sowing, the seeds are covered by thin layer of sand and then by paddy straw. 
The nursery is watered through rose can twice a day regularly. 
 On tenth day, copper oxychloride @ 2g / litre of water is sprayed to protect the 
seedlings from damping off disease. 
 
Drip irrigation  
 Installation of drip system is done with main and sub -main pipes and the inline lateral 
tubes are placed at an interval of 1.5 m. 
 The drippers in lateral tubes are placed at an interval of 60 cm and 50cm spacing 
with 4LPH and 3.5 LPH capacities respectively. 
 
Field preparation 
 The field selected for planting should be ploughed thorough ly by using chisel plough, 
disc plough and cultivator. 
 FYM @ 25t / ha and 75% of the total recommended dose of single superphosphate 
(285kg.) Azospirillum, phosphobacteria  2 kg / ha and Pseudomonos 2.5 kg / ha 
along with FYM 50 kg and neem cake @ 100g are applied before last ploughing. 
       
153 
 
 Along with biofetilizers , 50kg each of zinc suphate and ferrous sulphate are applied 
before last ploughing. 
 Raised beds of 1.2 m width and 30 cm height are formed for transplanting.  
 Drip irrigation is done @ 8 -12 hours depen ding upon the soil condition to get field 
capacity. 
 
Planting 
 Transplanting is done in rows at the spacing of 15 cm between rows (of 7 rows within 
the bed) and 10 cm between plants. 
 A total population of 4,70,000 seedlings are required to cover one hectare of land. 
After care 
 Drip irrigation is done @ 1 -2 hours per day depending upon the soil and climatic 
condition. 
 Weeding: First weeding is done on 30 th day after transplanting. Then weeding is 
done as and when necessary.   
 Fertigation: For big onion, 60:60 :30kg of NPK/ha is applied throughout the cropping 
period.  The nutritients are applied approximately once in three days. 
 
Harvesting and post harvest management 
 The harvesting is done 75 to 160 days after planting depending upon the varieties. 
 The irrigation is stopped 15 days before harvesting and sprayed with 2500 ppm of 
maleic hydrazide. This will prevent sprouting of the bulbs in storage, by which they 
can be stored even for 6-7 months. 
 The correct time of harvest is one week after 50% top fall. After lifting, the bulbs with 
tops should be cured in shade for 10 -15 days before storage to remove field heat. 
Then proper sorting and grading is done.

Soil and climate 
 
       Red sandy loam soils with good drainage will be ideal for its normal and fleshy growth, 
which will result in better leaf yield. The optimum temperature requirement is 26 to 37oC. 
 
Season of sowing and planting 
 
           The main season of availability of cu rry leaf fruits is July - August. After collection of 
fruits within 3-4 days, the seeds should be pulped and sown in nursery beds or poly bags.  
One year old seedlings are suitable for planting. One seedling is planted at the centre of the 
pit. 
 
Preparation of field 
 
          The field is ploughed 3 -4 times to get a fine tilth. Before last ploughing, well 
decomposed FYM is applied @ 20 tonnes/ha. Pits of 30 x30x30cm are dug one to two 
months before planting at a spacing of 1.2 to 1.5 m 
 
Irrigation 
 
        Immediately after planting the pits has to be  irrigated. On the third day the second 
irrigation is given, then the irrigation is given once in week. 
 
 
Application of fertilizers 
 
          After each harvest, 20 kg of FYM/plant is applied and mixed with soil. 
 
After cultivation 
         Periodical hoeing has to be given. During first year, one intercrop like pulses can be 
grown. After attaining 1 m  height, the terminal bud is nipped  off to encourage basal

 Lower elevation and less shady areas- Panniyur 1 
 Higher elevation and more shady areas - Karimunda 
 Intercropping in Arecanut – Panniyur 5 
 
Soil and climate 
  Pepper is grown ma inly as a rainfed crop. Pepper requires heavy rainfall (150 - 250 
cm), high humidity and warm climate. Thrives best on virgin soils rich in humus content and 
the crop can be grown at elevations up to 1500 m. 
 
Season 
  June - December. 
 
Planting 
  Slopes facing West and South should be avoided. Pits of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm 
size are dug at a spacing of 2 to 3 m in either direction (Panniyur 1 - 3 x 3 m).  
 
 5 to10 kg of FYM/Compost is mixed with top soil and the pits are filled. Rooted 
cuttings of black pepper are planted in June-July @ two per standard. Silver oak, Dadap and 
Jack can be used as standards and should be planted at a spacing of 7–8 m. 
 
Manuring 
  Apply cattle manure or compost @ 10 kg/vine - before the onset of South West 
monsoon. Apply 100:40:140 g of NPK per vine in two split doses during May - June and 
September - October. Slaked lime at 500 g per vine is applied in alternate years during May - 
June.  
 Apply Azospirillum @ 100 g/vine one month after the application of chemical 
fertilizers.  
Integrated nutrient management - Inorganic N 50 % of the recommended dose + FYM 10 kg 
+ 50 g Azospirillum + 50 g Phosphobacteria + 200 g VAM per plant.  
The manures and fertilizers are applied around the vine at a distance of 30 cm from the base 
and incorporated into the soil. 
 
Irrigation 
  Protective irrigation in basins during December - May at 10 days interval. 
 
Aftercultivation 
 Two weedings are given during the months of June - July and  October - November. 
The vines are to be trained to the standards. Excessive foliage of the standards may be 
pruned and the height of the standards may be limited to about 6 m. To increase the berry 
size, spray NAA @ 40 ppm.

Soil and climate 
  Cardamom is generally grown in forest loam soil with medium to high available 
phosphorous and potassium. Well drained forest loamy soil and red lateritic soil rich in 
organic matter wi th good drainage is preferable. The soil pH of 5.5 to 6.0 is highly ideal for 
cultivation. Cardamom cannot tolerate water logging. 
 Small cardamom is a pseophytic plant and prefers to grow under warm humid 
climate. It requires 40 -60 per cent shade. An annu al rainfall rang ing from 1500 to 4000 mm 
with even distribution is essential. Summer showers during February -April are very much 
important for the initiation of new panicles.  Temperature range of 10 oC to 32 oC and an 
altitude of 600 -1200 m above MSL are su ited for cultivation. However, good productivity is 
achieved when the cardamom is grown from 900 -1200 m above MSL. Areas with heavy 
winds should be avoided 
 
Season 
  June - December. 
 
Seeds and sowing

 Select healthy turmeric rhizomes for seed purpose 
 Treat the selected rhizomes wi th mancozeb (0.3%) and quinalphos (0.075%) for 30 
min and store in well ventilated place 
 One month before planting, the seed rhizomes are cut into single bud rhizomes  
(4g) with small piece of bud sprout weighing 5-7 g. 
 Treat the single bud sprouts (Mancozeb 0.3%) for 30 min before planting 
 Fill the protrays (98 c ells) with nursery medium containing partially decomposed coir 
pith and vermicompost (75:25), enriched with PGPR/Trichoderma 10g/kg of  mixture 
 Plant the turmeric bud sprouts in protrays 
 Maintain the protrays under shade net house (50%) 
 Adopt need based irrigation with rose can or by using suitable sprinklers               
 Transplants will be  ready within 30-35 days for transplanting

  June - December. Slopes facing South and West should be avoided. North and 
North-Eastern slope is preferred. 
 
Propagation 
  Seeds 
 
Nursery practices 
  The seeds are sown in beds at 2 to 3 cm spacing and a depth of about 2 cm. The 
germination commences in about 5 to 6 weeks . The germinated seedlings are transpla nted 
in polythene bags (30 x 15 cm) containing a mixture of soil,sand and well decomposed co w 
dung (3:3:1 ratio).The seedlings are ready for transplanting in the field when they are 18 to 
24 months. 
 
Planting 
  Seeds are extracted from ripe fruits and sown immediately in poly bags. The seeds 
germinate in five to six weeks. Take 30 x 30 x30cm pits @ 6m x 6m spacing. Fill the pits with 
top soil, 50 g Azospirillum and FYM 10 kg/pit. Two years old seedlings are planted in pits.  
 
After cultivation 
 Provide shade for seedlings.  
 Mulch the basins with dried leaves. 
 Weeding is done as and when necessary.  
 Provide shade during the initial establishment by raising banana. 
 Small temporary pandal may also provide partial shade during initial establishment. 
 Dead and diseased shoots should be removed periodically. 
 
Irrigation 
  Frequent watering is essential in the initial stages in the absence of rains. Apply 8 
litres of water either through drip or through basin during the months of January – May. 
 
Manuring 
 One year old plants can be applied with FYM 15 kg, 20:20:60 g of NPK per plant in 
two splits during June  - July and September - October.Every year the dosage is 
correspondingly increased and a bearing tree of 7 years old may be applied with FYM 50 kg, 
300:300:960 g of NPK per plant . 50 g in each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria to be 
applied one month after manuring.

  Friable, well drained clay to red soils are suitable. It can be grown up to an elevation 
of 1000m with 150-250cm of rainfall under humid tropical climate. 
 
 
Propagation 
  Seeds /grafts/ budded plants.  
 
 
Seed Propagation 
  Seeds are collected from regular bearing and high yielding trees (more than 10,000 
fruits per tree per year) and having 30 g weight/fruit, 1 g wet mace /fruit and 10 g wet weight 
of nuts / fruit. Seeds are harv ested during June – July. Sown immediately after extraction in 
beds at a spacing of 30 cm and 2.5 – 5.0 cm deep. Ger mination commences from 40 days, 
extends up to 90 days after sowing and transplanted to poly bags (35 x 15 cm). One year old 
seedlings are t ransplanted to bigger poly bags (35 x 20 cm). Seedlings are transplanted to 
main field after 18-24 months. 
 
Vegetative propagation 
  Epicotyl grafting or Grafting ( Approach method) or budding (Patch method) is 
recommended to perpetuate high yielding nutmeg  types. Best sea son is from October to 
January.Use only orthotropic shoots as scion materials. 
 
Precuring of scion 
 The scions with 2 to 3 leaves, collected from the high yielding tree can be used for 
grafting purpose 
 Straight growing shoots (orthotropic or  chupon) should be always used as scion to get 
normal shaped nutmeg trees. 
 Plagiotrophs are used to get bushy type plant  
 
Season and planting 
  Plant 12 - 18 months old seedlings/ grafts/ budded plants in pits of 60 x 60x 60 cm 
size. Take pits at a spacing of 8 m x 8 m. Fill with equal parts of forest soil and cattle 
manure. Season of planting is June – December.  
 
 
Manuring 
  Apply FYM 15 kg, 20:20:60 g of NPK per tree during first year and FYM 50 kg, 
300:300:960 g of NPK for adult trees (15 years onwards) in two splits June - July, 
September - October. Apply 50 g in each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria one month 
after manuring.

Propagation 
Seeds 
  Seeds are collected from high yielding and regular bearing trees. Seeds are 
extracted after soaking the fruits overnight in water and rubbing them in a sieve and washing  
with clean water. The seeds are ready for sowing after drying them in shade. 
 Nursery beds of 1.2 m width are prepared with light soil incorporated with organic 
matter or a mixture of sand and coir dust or coir dust alone. After sowing , the beds are 
mulched to hasten germination. Dried leaves, paper and damp sacks are used as mulches. 
Germination takes place 15 days after sowing. After three weeks , the seedlings may be 
transferred to polybags. 
 
Vegetative propagation 
  Air layering in the month of January. 
 
Planting 
  9-10 months old seedlings of 25-30 cm height are used for field planting

Chapter D 
12.  Other Spices 
1.  VANILLA (Vanilla planifolia); Orchidaceae 
 
Soil 
 Lateritic soil rich in humus having good drainage. 
Climate 
 Humid tropical climate with an annual rainfall of 150 – 300 cm (well distributed for a 
period of 9 months and dry period of 3 months). Elevation: 700 – 1500 m MSL and with 
latitude of 100 N and 200 S. Temperature: 210C – 320C.  
 
Standards 
  Glyricidia sp, Erythrina indica, Jatropha curcus, Plumeria alba and Casuarina 
equisetifolia. Planting during on-set of rain after summer during May and June.  
 
Season for vanilla planting 
  6 months after planting standards (i.e.) September – November. 
 
Propagation 
 Stem cuttings of 60 – 120 cm  
Spacing 
 Plains : 2.0 to 2.5 m X 1.2 – 1.5 m  
 Hills    : 1.5 x 1.5 m  
Planting 
  Pit size 30x30x30cm for standards and for planting of vanilla cuttings.  Place 2 nodes 
of unrooted cuttings below the soil surface.  
 
Training 
 Train the vines to a height of 1.2 to 1.5 m.  Then trained horiz ontally or allowed to 
grow downward towards the ground. Horizontally trained vines are coiled round the pole 
connecting the two supporting trees. Vines trained to grow downward is allowed to touch the 
soil and allowed to root and again brought back upward on the same supporting tree and the 
same procedure is repeated. 
 
Mulching 
  Mulch the vine with pruned vegetation 2 – 3 times in a year. 
 
Recommended dose of fertilizers  
 Apply 40 – 60: 20 – 30: 60 – 100 g of NPK per vine per year. It is given in 2 to 3 
splits. Spray 1 % solution of 17: 17: 17 NPK mixture once in a month for boosting growth and 
flower production. 
 
Flowering 
 Flowering starts in the third year of plan ting during December – January. Pinching of 
top 7.5 – 10 cm of vine 6 – 8 months before flo wering seasons encourages flower bud 
initiation. Pruning of older fruiting branches also encourages flower production.  Each 
inflorescence consists of 15 – 20 flowers.  
 
       
191 
 
Pollination 
 The artificial pollination is useful in vanilla and pollination must be d one on the same 
day as flowers start opening from 4.00 am and extend upto 1.00 pm.  About 10 to 20 
inflorescences may be pollinated in a vine.  Normally 5 to 6 flowers in the lower side of 
inflorescence are pollin ated. Hand pollination is done using a needle  or a piece of pointed 
wood or a tooth pick to lift the hood covering the anther cap so that the anthers are brought 
into contact with stigma. A skilled worker can pollinate 1000 – 1500 flowers in a day. 
 
Plant Protection 
Pest 
 
Leaf eating beetles, Feeding bugs and Caterpillars: 
  Spray quinolphos @ 0.05 %. 
 
Diseases

Phytophthora rot  
 Spray 1% bordeaux mixture or soil drenching with copper oxychloride @ 0.2 % 
Sclerotium rot 
 Soil drenching with carbendazim 0.1 %  
 
Harvesting 
  The pods are ready for harvest in 6 to 9 months after flowering. The matured beans 
change colour from green to pale yellow. The right picking stage is when the distal end of the 
pod turns yellow. Daily picking of matured pod is essential. T he pods are harvested by 
cutting with a knife. 
 
Yield 
  Average cured bean yield is 300 to 600 kg / ha / year.  6 kg of green pods produce 1 
kg of cured beans. The economic life of vine is 12 – 14 years.

1.  Tea (Camellia sinensis L. O. Kuntze.); Camelliaceae 
 
Varieties 
  Pandian, Sundaram, Golconda, Jayaram, Evergreen, Athrey, Brookeland, BSS 
1,BSS 2, BSS 3, BSS 4, BSS 5 
 
Soil and climate 
  Tea requires well drained soil with high amount of organic matter and pH 4.5 to 5.5. 
The performance of tea is excellent at elevations ranging from 1000 - 2500 m. Optimum 
temperature is 20-27 o C. 
 
Nursery 
  The nursery soil should be well drained and deep loam in nature with pH of 4.5 to 
4.8. The rooting medium should be tested for pH and free from nematode infestation. 
 
Pre-treatment of rooting medium 
 Treating with Aluminium sulphate can reduce soil pH. For this purpose , the nursery 
soil is formed into beds of one metre width and about 8 cm height and of a convenient 
length. Then the beds  are drenched with 2 % solution of Aluminium sulphate applied at 10 
litres per 2.5 m 2 of area. Over this another layer of soil of 8 cm height is spread and again 
drenched with equal quantity of water twice. Then the soil is allowed to dry and the pH is 
checked before use in the nursery. 
 
Preparation of sleeves 
  Polythene bags of 30 – 45 cm length, 10 cm width and 150 or 200 guage thickness 
may be used. Drainage holes may be provided. The lower 3/4 of the sleeves should be filled 
with 1:3 sand and soil mixt ure and the top 1/4 with 1:1 sand and soil mixture and staked in 
rows. Overhead shade is provided. 
 
Selection and preparation of mother bush 
  Healthy and vigorously growing high yielding bushes should be selected. For 
selected bush, application of 0.5 % A lSO4+ 1 % Mg SO4 as foliar spray is recommende d. 
One week later, apply 2 % Zn SO4. After one week apply 1 % Urea. Then 40 g of young tea 
mixture 60:90 NK mixture per bush may be applied upto 5 years.  
 
Preparation of cuttings 
  Cuttings are taken on April - May and August - September. Semi hardwood cuttings 
are prepared with one full leaf and an internode with a slanting cut at the bottom. 
 
Planting of cuttings 
  The sleeves are watered thoroughly and holes are made in the soil. The cuttings are 
inserted in t he hole and the soil around is pressed firmly to avoid airspace followed by 
watering. Small polythene tents may be provided which maintain high humidity and regulate 
the temperature inside. Cuttings may take 10 - 12 weeks for rooting. After 90 days - when all 
the cuttings have rooted, the polythene tent may be removed gradually over a period of 10 – 
15 days. 
 
       
193 
 
Manuring of nursery 
  After the tent is removed, the cuttings are sorted and staked. 30 g of Nursery soluble 
mixture of the following composition dis solved in 10 litres of water may be applied over an 
area of 4 sq.m. This should be done fortnightly. 
 
 
Composition of the fertilizer 
 
Ammonium phosphate (20:20)  35 parts by Weight 
Potassium sulphate   15 parts by Weight 
 (or) MOP     12 parts by Weight 
Magnesium sulphate              15 parts by Weight 
Zinc sulphate                  3 parts by Weight 
Total       80 parts by Weight 
 
Hardening of the cuttings 
  Hardening of 4 - 6 months old young cuttings should be done by removing shade 
gradually in stages over a period of 4 - 6 weeks starting from a few hours exposure to sun 
every day initially and extending the time of exposure gradually. 
 
 
Methods of planting 
 
Single Hedge System 
  Planted at the spacing of 1.20 x 0.75 m accommodating 10,800 plants/ha.

Kaoline 2 lit + 2 kg of wetting agent in 450 lit of water followed by Gramoxone 500 ml in 200 
lit of water to control dicot weeds. 
 
Training young tea 
Centering 
  To induce more laterals , centering should be done 3 - 5 months after planting. The 
main leader stem should be cut, leaving 8 - 10 matured leaves. 
 
 
 
Tipping 
 First tipping at a height of 35 cm and second tipping  at 60 cm respectively from 
ground level. 
 
Pruning 
  To maintain convenient height and vegetative growth and to remove dead and 
diseased branches, pruning is done. 
Area to be pruned every year =    Total extent of the garden 
                  
              Pruning cycle 
 
Pruning interval = (Elevation in feet / 1000) + 1 
Pruning should be done in April - May and August – September respectively in S.W and NE 
monsoon areas. 
 
Types of pruning 
 
Rejuvenation pruning 
 The whole bush should be cut near the ground level less than 30 cm with a view to 
rejuvenate the bushes. 
 
Hard pruning 
  Formation pruning of young tea at 30 to 45 cm (12" to 18") for proper spread of 
bushes. 
 
Medium pruning 
  To check the bush growing to an inconvenient height this type of pruning i s done in 
order to stimulate new wood and to maintain the foliage at lower levels less than 60 cm. 
 
Light pruning 
 Pruning depends on the previous history of the bush raising the height of medium 
pruning by an inch or less to manageable heights for plucking (less than 65 cm). 
 
Skiffing 
  This is the lightest of all pruning methods. Remove the top 5 - 8 cm new growth to 
obtain a uniform level of pruning surface (more than 65 cm). 
 
Shade regulation 
  Pollarding of shade trees should be done prior to heavy rai ns at a height of 8 - 10 m 
from the ground level.

Backing shower during April – May is required for both the varieties. 
 
Propagation 
  By seeds. 
 
Preparation of seeds 
  Healthy and well developed fully ripe berries are harvested from specially identified 
plants for use as seed bearers. After discarding the floats, the sound fruits are depulped, 
sieved and mixed with sieved wood ash and dried in shade. The seed is then graded to 
       
197 
 
remove all cut, triangular  and elephant beans. Prior to planting, the seeds a re treated with 
agrosan or any organomercurial compound to prevent fungal infection. 
 
Nursery practices 
  Select light loamy soil of good drainage and high organic matter content with water 
and shade facil ities. Form raised beds of 15 cm height, 1m width and of convenient length.  
Incorporate 30 - 40 kg of well rotten compost, 2 kg of finely sieved agricultural lime and 400 
g of rock phosphate to a bed of 1 x 6 m size.  In heavy soils, it is necessary to add coarse 
sand for drainage and aeration. 
 
Sowing 
 Pre-sowing seed treatment with Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria can be done.  
Seeds are sown in December - January in the bed 1.5 - 2.5 cm apart with the flat side down 
wards in regular rows. Then they are cov ered with a thin layer of fine soil and a layer of 
paddy straw. Water the beds daily and protect from direct sunlight by an over head pandal. 
Seeds germinate in about 45 days after which they are transplanted to secondary nu rsery 
beds for raising ball or bag nursery. 
 
Bag nursery 
 Polythene bags with adequate number of holes in the bottom half are taken and are 
filled with a prepared mixture containing jungle soil, FYM in the proportion of 6:2:1.  An area 
of 12 x 8 m can accommodate 5000 seedlings. Seedlings are planted in polythene bags.  
 
Season 
 June - September. 
 
Preparation of field 
  Selective felling may be done while retaining a number of desirable shade trees.  
Terracing should be done in deep slopy areas.  After the summer showers, pits of                        
45x45x45cm are dug. The pits are left open for weathering and then filled and heaped for 
planting. At the time of filling, apply 500 g of rock phosphate per pit along with top soil. 
Planting is done along the contour in slopy areas. 
 
Spacing 
 Arabica coffee: 1.5 to 2.0 m either way. 
 Dwarf varieties: San Ramon: 1 x 1 m. 
 Robusta coffee: 2.5 m either way. 
 
Planting shade trees 
  Dadap is commonly used as a lower canopy shade. Stakes of 2 m length are 
planted for every two coffee plants. Silver Oak and Dadaps are planted during June when 
South-West monsoon commences. During summer the stem of young Dadaps are painted 
with diluted lime or wrapped with polythene sheets in order to prevent them from sun scorch. 
Regulate shade by cutting criss -cross branches during monsoon season. Silver oak trees 
are planted at 6x6m for permanent shade. 
 
Irrigation 
  It is generally grown as a rainfed crop. But irrigation with sprinkler during March - 
April increases blossoming and results in higher yields.

slopes upto 600 - 700 feet elevation are suitable for cultivation. 
 
Season:  June - December. 
Seed Treatment for Nursery 
The cashew seeds should be soaked in water for 12-24 hours before sowing and the floats 
are removed those which sink to the bottom  should be used for planting. 
 
Propagation :  Soft wood grafting, air layer and epicotyl grafting.  
Requirement of plants :  200 plants/ha. 
Preparation of field 
  Pits of 45 x45x45cm size are dug and filled up with a mixture of soil + 10 kg FYM + 
one kg neem cake. 
 
Spacing: 7 m either way. 
 
 
High density planting 
 Spacing of 5 x 4 m accommodating 500 plants per hect are is recommended. Prune 
the interlocking branches during July-August to maintain the frame.

Irrigation 
  Normally grown as a rainfed crop. Irrigation once in a week from flowering to fruit 
maturity stage is good to increase the yield.  
 
Intercropping 
 Plough the interspaces af ter the receipt of rain and raise either groundnut or black 
gram or bhendi till the trees reach bearing age.  
 
Training and pruning 
  Develop the trunk to a height of 1 m by removing low lying branches. The dried twigs 
and branches should be removed every year. 
 
Rejuvenation of cashew orchards 
In older cashew plantations, removal of dried or dead wood, criss -cross branches, 
water shoots etc. should be done at least once in 2 -3 years. Redevelopment of canopy is 
possible by heading back of existing senile trees which have exhausted canopies and erratic 
growth resulting in reduced yield. Heading back if done at 1.0 -1.5 m height of the trees new 
flushes will emerge from dormant buds on remaining trunk and develops into a vigorous new 
canopy. By and large old cashew plantations are of seedling origin and have become senile. 
Such trees can be rejuvenated by grafting with scion sticks of improved and high yielding 
varieties on new shoots arising on beheaded stumps. May -June is the right time for 
beheading and July -August is for grafting. However, preventative measures need to be 
taken to monitor each plant for the attack of cashew stem and root borer on the top worked 
trees.

Die back or pink disease 
 Prune the affected shoots just below the affected portion and apply bordeaux paste  
 Spray 1% bordeaux mixture or copper oxychloride @ 0.25 % twice in May - June and 
October as a prophylactic measure 
Harvest 
  The plant starts yielding from 3 rd year onwards. The peak picking months are March 
to May. Good nuts are grey green, smooth and well filled. After picking, the nuts are 
separated from the apple and dried in the sun for two to three days to bring down the 
moisture content to 10 to 12 %. Properly dried nuts are packed in alkathene bags. This will 
keep for 6 months. 
 
Yield: 3 - 4 kg/tree/year.

Soil and climate 
 Potash rich alluvial soils friable in nature with high humus and moisture retentivity 
with a pH of 6.6 - 7.0 are suitable. Cocoa is normally cultivated at altitudes upto  
1200 m above MSL with an annual rainfall of 150 cm and a relative humidity of 80 % and 
annual mean temperature of 240C to 250C. Cocoa can be grown as intercrop in coconut and 
arecanut gardens. 
 
Season :   June - July and September - October. 
 
Seeds and sowing 
  Propagated by seeds. Before sowing the seeds the pu lp adhering to the seeds has 
to be removed. Cocoa seeds are individually sown in polybags soon after extraction.  
 
Pot mixture 
 The bags are filled with pot mixture containing. 
 Red soil -2 parts 
 Sand -1 part 
       
204 
 
 FYM- 1 part 
 Superphosphate – 5 kg/t of the above mixture 
 This can be filled in 320 gauge polythene bag with 30 cm height and 20 cm width 
provided with two holes in the bottom. Nursery plants are ready for transplanting at 6 months 
of age when they attain a height of 60 cm. 
 
Planting 
  Seedlings are transplanted with a ball of earth in 45x45x45cm pits at a spacing of 3 x 
3 m either way. Stake the plants to ensure upright growth and early establishment. 
Periodical mulching with leaves and watering should be done. Temporary shade has to be 
provided. 
 
Time and method of planting 
Cocoa is a shade loving plant. During its seedling period it requires about 50% shade 
and later the shade requirement is about 40%. The plant is grown as a mixed crop with other 
plants like spices and rubber mainly under rainfed cond itions. Cocoa is planted as an 
intercrop in coconut and arecanut gardens.

Cocoa as inter crop 
Coconut 7.5 x 7.5 
One cocoa row of plants at 3m interval at the center of two 
coconut rows and one cocoa at the center of two c oconut 
plants along the coconut row. This layout will hold about 500 
plants per hectare 
Arecanut 2.7 x 2.7 
One cocoa row of plants at 2.7m interval at the center of two 
arecanut rows. Likewise alternate gaps of recanut rows 
should be filled in. This layout will hold about 686 plants/ha. 
Oil palm 4.5 x 4.5 Five cocoa plants would come between four oil  palm plants 
resulting in 400 plants per hectare. 
 
Irrigation in cocoa  
Cocoa is usually grown in areas where water availability is adequate. Cocoa plants 
are sensitive to drought, irrigation in such cases becomes essential. During summer, as it 
exists in Southern India, the crop requires irrigation at weekly intervals. When it is grown as 
mixed crop with arecanut, the crop is to be irrigated once in a week during Novemb er-
December, once in 6 days during January -March and once in 4-5 days during April-May with 
175 litres of water.

trees under tapping, apply NPK 10:10:10 grade mixtures at the rate of 900 g/tree (300 kg/ha) 
every year in two split doses. Add 10 kg commercial Magnesium sulphate for every 100 kg 
of the above mixture, if there is magnesium deficiency. 
 
After cultivation 
  Growing of cover crops, incorporation of cover crops and weeding are important 
operations for soil conservation. Pueraria phaseoloides, Calopagonium muconoides, 
Centrosema pubescens and Desmodium evalifolium are common cover crops. 
       
209 
 
 
Intercrops 
  Banana, pineapple, tuber crops ( Amorphophallus, dioscorea , colocasia and arrowroot), 
ginger, turmeric, vegetables ( cowpea, cucumber, bhendi, amaranthus), cocoa, medicinal plants 
(Strobilanthus haenianus  (Karimkurinji), Adhatoda vasi ca                               (Valiya Adalodakam ) 
and Plumbago rosea  (Chuvanna Koduveli ) can be grown in the initial 4 to 5 years.   
 
Mulching 
  Mulching or covering the plant basin with dry leaves, cover crop cuttings, grass cuttings, 
paddy straw etc is  recommended . Protection of young rubber p lants from strong sun: Using plaited 
coconut leaf tree guards and white  washing brown portions of the main stem  
 
Branch induction  
  The rubber plants should be induced to produce branches at a height of 2.5 - 3 m 
to achieve high rate of growth with increased girth through leaf cap or leaf folding 
method. In young green tissues, the leaf folding or leaf cap method can be used. In the leaf 
folding method, the leaves of the top whorl are folded down at the point of con tact of the 
petiole with the lamina using only the upper few leaves to enclose the apical bud. The leaves 
are then tied with a rubber band. After three to four weeks they are released. In plants where 
the terminal whorl of leaves is in the leaflet or bud b reak stage, the leaf cap method is 
recommended. Here, three mature leaflets are taken to form a cap to enclose the terminal 
bud and tied with a rubber band. The cap is then removed three to four weeks later. 
 
Tapping 
 Trees attain tappable stage in about 7  years. First tapping in seedling trees will commence 
when the trunk attains a girth of 55 cm at 50 cm height from the ground. In budded trees , the 
girth should be 50 cm at 125 cm height from the bud union. The depth of tapping should be 1 
mm close to camb ium, since greater number of latex vessels are concentrated near the 
cambium

Ethrel treatment 
  Ethrel is recommended to increase latex yield of trees tapped on panel D. It is 
applied at 5 % a.i. concentration with a brush below the tapping cut to a width of 5 cm after 
light scraping of the outer bark. The first application may be done after a drought period 
preferably after a few pre -monsoon showers and subsequent applications may be done in 
September and November. However, continuous application of Ethrel is not recommended 
for periods of more than 3 years at a stretch. 
 
Tapping panel dryness (Brown blast) 
 Syndrome characterized by prolonged dripping of latex with the gradual decline in 
volume yield, pre coagulation of latex and partial or complete drying of tapping area (10 -25 
per cent). 
 
Control : Reduce tapping intensity or give a tapping rest for 3 to 12 months.

FYM, red earth and sand mixed in equal proportions. At the center of the pit, remove the soil 
mixture and  plant the seedling after removing all the roots. Press the soil well around the 
seedling and provide the seedling with s hade by using plaited coconut leaves or palmyrah 
leaves. Keep the pits free from weeds. Remove soil covering the collar region.  As the 
seedlings grow and form stem, fill up the pits gradually by cutting the sides.

March – September 410 lit / 5 days*  October – February 410 lit /8 days* 
* Quantity of water to be applied in the basin. Add 30-40 % of the above quantity of water 
(135 -165 litres/palm) to meet the conveyance loss. 
 
For drip irrigation, open four pits size of 30 x 30 x 30 cm opposite to each other at 
one meter distance from the trunk. Place 40 cm long PVC conduit pipe (16 mm) in a slan ting 
position in each pit and place the drippers inside the conduit tube and allow the water to drip  
30  cm  below  the  soil surface. Fill the pits with coir pith to prevent evaporation. 
 
In the first year, irrigate on alternate days and from the second year to the time of 
maturity irrigate twice in a week based on the water requirement. 
 
 
Drought management and soil moisture conservation 
Mulching with coconut husks/leaves/coir pith 
 Apply coconut husks with convex surface facing upwards (100 Nos.) or dri ed coconut 
leaves (15 Nos) or coir pith up to a height of 10 cm in the basin of 1.8 m radius  around  the 
palms as mulch  for soil moisture conservation particularly during summer season. 
 
Burial of coconut husk or coir pith 
 Husk burial can be done in coconut basins or in the interspaces to overcome drought 
and button shedding. Bury husks @ 100 Nos. with concave surface facing upwards or 25 kg 
of coir pith/palm in circular trenches, dug 30 cm width  and 60 cm depth at 1.5 metres radius.  
The husk can be also buried in the trenches at a distance of 3 m from the palm with a size of 
45 cm deep and 150 cm width in between tw o rows of coconut. The soaking of the coconut 
husk or coir pith as the case may be preserves the monsoon rains. 
       
214 
 
 
 
 
Manuring 
 From 5th year onwards, apply 50 kg of FYM or compost or green manure.1.3 kg Urea 
(560 g N), 2.0 kg Superphosphate (320 g P2O5) and 2.0 kg Muriate of potash (1200 g K2O) in 
two equal splits during June – July and December – January.  Apply manures and fertilizers 
in circular basins of 1.8 m from the base of the palm, incorporate and irrigate. During 2nd, 
3rd and 4th year ¼, ½ and ¾ doses of the above fertilizer schedule should be adopted 
respectively. Sufficient moisture should be present at the time of manuring. Fertigati on may 
be done at monthly intervals with 75% of the recommended dose of the above fertilizers. 
Phosphorous may be applied as super phosphate in the basins and incorporated or as DAP 
through drip when good quality of water is available. TNAU micronutrient m ixture is 
recommended @ 1.0kg/tree/year. 
 
TNAU coconut tonic nutrition 
 For nut bearing coconut Palm, root feed TNAU coconut tonic @200ml/palm once in 
six months. 
 
Bio-fertilizer recommendation 
 
 At the time of planting, apply 50g of Azospirillum, 50 g of Phosphobacteria (or) 50 g 
of Azophos and 50 g of AM fungi. Mix all the contents with sufficient quantity of FYM or any 
compost. After planting apply the above biofertilizers once in 6 months/palm near to the 
feeding roots as that of fertilizer application 
 
 
Organic recycling 
Any one of the green manure crops like sunnhemp, wild indigo, calapagonium or 
daincha may be sown and ploughed in situ at the time of flowering as a substitute of  
compost to be applied.  Sow sunnhemp @ 50 g/palm in the basin and incorpo rate before 
flowering. Coir pith compost/vermicompost made from coir pith/ coconut leaves/ other 
wastes from coconut grove can be applied. 
 
 
Intercultural operation weed management 
 The interspace in the coconut garden has to be ploughed twice in a year in  June-July 
and December - January. Intercultural operation is essential to keep weed population under 
check, to enhance the utilisation of the applied plant nutrients by  the coconut trees , to 
facilitate proper aeration to the roots of coconut, to induce fresh root growth. 
 
Weed management 
 For the broad -leaved weeds, pre -emergence spraying of atrazine @1.0  kg  a.i./  ha  
for  the control of grasses and sedges, p ost emergence spraying of glyphosate @ 10 ml and 
20 g Ammonium sulphate/litre of water. 
 
Inter cropping 
 Inter/mixed crops may be selected based on the climatic requirement of the 
inter/mixed crop, irrigation facilities and soil type. The canopy size, age and spacing of the 
coconut are also to be considered. Market suitability should be taken into co nsideration 
before selecting an intercrop. 
 
       
215 
 
Below 7 years of age: Any suitable annual crop for particular soil type and climatic condition 
may be raised as intercrops upto 5 years after planting depending upon the canopy 
coverage. Groundnut, sesamum, sunf lower, tapioca, turmeric and banana can be grown. 
Avoid crops like paddy and sugarcane etc. 
 
7 – 20 years of age : Green manure crops and fodder crops (Napier grass and guinea  
grass)  alone can be grown. 
 
 
Above 20 years of age (20 years of age has to be a djusted based on the sunlight 
transmission of above 50% inside the canopy). 
 
 The following crops can be grown depending on the soil and climatic suitability. 
(i) Annuals : Groundnut, b hendi, turmeric, tapioca, sweet potato, 
sirukizhangu, elephant foot yam, ginger, pineapple 
(ii) Biennials : Banana varieties, poovan and monthan are suitable. 
(iii) Perennials : Cocoa*, pepper* (Panniyur 1 or Panniyur 2 or Panniyur 5 or 
Karimunda), nutmeg* and vanilla* 
 
*Suitable areas are Pollachi tract of western region and Kanyakumari dis trict. For 
vanilla,  
  use disease free planting material and maintain high vigilance to maintain a disease free 
crop. 
 
 
Multiple cropping system 
Coconut + banana + sirukizhangu + bhendi is suitable system for the eastern region.  
Crops like banana, pepper , cocoa, nutmeg, vanilla can be tried under multiple cropping 
system in  suitable areas in the western region. In all the systems, apply recommended 
quantity of water and manures and fertilizers to the intercrops separately. 
 
 
Crop physiology 
 
Root feeding of TNAU c oconut t onic @ 200 ml / palm twice a year at six months 
interval decreases button shedding and increases the number and size of nuts. 
 
Crop protection- Pest management 
Pests Management 
strategies 
Rhinoceros beetle 
Oryctes rhinoceros 
 Remove and bu rn all dead coconut trees in the garden (which  
are likely to serve as breeding ground) to maintain  good 
sanitation. 
 Collect and destroy the v arious bio -stages of the beetle  from  
the  manure pits (breeding ground of the pest) whenever 
manure  is  lifted from the pits. 
 Incorporate the entomopathogen i.e, fungus (Metarrhizium 
anisopliae) in manure pits to check the perpetuation of the  
pest. 
 Soak castor cake at 1 kg in  5 l of water in small mud pots and 
keep them in the coconut gardens to attract and kill the adults. 
 Treat the longitudinally split tender coconut stem and green 
petiole of fronds with fresh toddy and keep them in the garden 
to attract and trap the beetles. 
 Examine the crowns of tree at every harvest and hook out and 
kill the adults. 
 For seedlings , apply 3 naphthalene balls/palm weighing 3.5 g 
each  at  the base of inter space in leaf sheath in the 3 inner 
       
216 
 
most leaves of the crown once in 45 days. 
Set up light traps following the first rains in summer and  
monsoon period to attract and kill the adult beetles. 
 Field release of Baculovirus inoculated adult rhinoceros beetle 
@ 15/ha reduces  the leaf and crown damage caused by this 
beetle. 
 Apply mixture of either neem seed powder + sand (1:2) @150 
g per palm or neem seed kernel powder + sand (1:2) @150 g  
per palm in the base of the 3 inner most leaves in the crown. 
 Set up rhinolure pheromone trap @ 1/ 2 ha to trap and kill the  
beetles. 
Black headed caterpillar 
Opisina arenosella 
 The incidence of the pest is noticed from the month of 
November to May and f rom August to November after rainfall.  
The coconut trees of all ages are attacked. 
  Release the larval ( Bethylid, Braconid and Ichneumonid) and 
pupal ( Eulophid) on (chalcid) parasitoids and predators 
periodically from January,  to check the build up of the  pest 
during summer. 
 Among the larval parasitoids, the bethylid Goniozus nephantidis 
is the most effective in controlling the pest. The optimum level of 
release is 1:8 of host-parasitoid ratio. The parasitoi should be 
released @3000/ha under the coconut trees when the pest is in 
the 2nd or 3rd instar larval stage. Parasitoid release trap may be 
used to release the parasitoid at the site of feeding. Parasitoids 
should not be released in the crown region since they will be 
killed by predators like spiders and reduviid bugs. 
 Remove and burn all affected leaves/leaflets. 
 Spray Malathion 50 EC 0.05% (1mi/lit) to cover the 
undersurface of the leaves thoroughly in case of severe 
epidemic outbreak of the pest in young palms. 
 Root feeding for the control of coconut B lack headed 
caterpillar: Select  a fresh and live root, cut sharply  at an angle 
and insert the root   in the insecticidal solution containing 
monocrotophos 36 WSC 10 ml + water 10 ml in a 7 x 10 cm 
polythene bag. Secure the bag tightly to the root with a cotton 
thread. Twenty four hours later, check whether there is 
absorption. If there is no absorption select another root. These 
methods should not be resorted to as a routine practice and it  is 
suggested only for cases of severe epidemic outbreak of the 
pest and when the survival of the tree is threatened. 
Red palm weevil 
Rhynchophorus ferrugineus 
 Remove and burn all wilting or damaged palms in coconut 
gardens to prevent further perpetuation of the pest. 
 Avoid injuries on stems of palms as the wounds may  serve  as 
oviposition sites for the weevil. Fill all holes in the stem with  
cement. 
 Avoid the cutting of green leaves. If needed, they should be cut 
about 120 cm away from the stem. 
 Fill the crown and the axils of top most three leaves with  a 
mixture  of  fine sand and neem seed powder or neem seed 
kernel powder  (2:1) once in three months to prevent the attack 
of rhinoceros  beetle damage in which the red palm weevil lays  
eggs. 
 Setting up of attractant traps  (mud  pots)  containing  sugarcane 
molasses 2½ kg or toddy 2½ litres + acetic acid 5 ml + yeast 5 g 
       
217 
 
 
+ longitudinally split tender coconut  stem/logs  of green  petiole  
of leaves of 30 numbers in one acre to trap adult red palm 
weevils in large numbers. 
 Install pheromone trap @1/2 ha 
Root feeding: As under black headed caterpillar 
Termites 
Odontotermes obesus 
 Locate termite mounds in or near the coconut nursery or 
garden and destroy. 
 Swabbing with neem oil 5% once on the base and upto 2 m 
height of  the trunk for effective control. 
 Spray copper sulphate 1% or cashew nut shell oil 80% or spray 
chlorphyriphos @ 3ml/lit of water, neem oil 5% or NSKE 20% to  
preserve plaited coconut leaves from the termite attack. 
Scale insect 
Aspidiotus destructor 
 Pluck mature nuts and spray monocrotophos 36 WSC 1 ml/ha. 
 Do not harvest nuts for 45 days after spraying. 
Mealy bugs 
Pseudococcus longispinus 
 Remove leaflets harbouring these insects and destroy them 
 Spray any one of the 
following : Malathion 50 EC 
2 ml/lit Dimethoate 30 EC 1 
ml/lit Methyl demeton 25 EC 
1 ml/lit  
 Monocrotophos 36 WSC 1 ml/lit Neem oil 30ml/lit. 
Leaf caterpillars 
Turnaca acuta

New invasive pest -
Coconut Rugose 
spiraling whitefly 
        The coconut rugose spiraling whitefly was noticed in serious 
proportion in various district coconut gardens of Tamil Nadu. The 
insects suck the sap and cause damage in the leaf fronts with 
copious honey dew secretions on the leav es. It induce 
development of sooty mould fungus there by leaves become 
completely black and reduces the photosynthesis rate. 
The following TNAU technologies can be adopted to manage the 
spiraling whitefly, 
 Release of Encarsia guadeloupae @ 100 parasitoids /ac (10 
leafbits/ac) 
 Installation of yellow sticky traps (5 ft. x 1.5 ft.) smeared with 
castor oil @ 5/ ac 
 Release of Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi eggs @ 500/ac in 
young palms 
 Pesticide holiday‘ must be declared to conserve the natural 
enemies fauna 
 
 
Palm civet 
Vivera zibatha 
 Use of Palm civet trap

Diseases management 
Basal stem rot (Ganoderma lucidum) 
 Aureofungin-sol @ 2g + copper sulphate @ 1g dissolved in 100 ml water or 
hexaconazole @ 2 ml with 100 ml of water , applied as root feeding for 3 times at 3 
months interval.  (The active absorbing root of pencil thickness b e selected and a 
slanting cut is made. The solution is taken in a polythene bag or bottle and the cut end 
of the root is dipped in the solution)  
 Forty liters of 1% Bordeaux mixture should be applied as soil drench around the trunks in 
a radius of 1.5 meter  
 Neem cake @ 5 kg/tree can be appl ied along with fertilizers and a zotobactor @ 200 
g/tree 
 
Bud rot (Phytophthora palmivora) 
 The infected tissues from the crown region should be removed and protected with 
Bordeaux paste 
 Spray 1% b ordeaux mixture  or coppe r oxychloride @ 0.25 % on cro wn region as 
pre-monsoon spray  
 Spray copper oxychloride @ 0.25 % after the onset of monsoon 
 
Stem bleeding (Ceratocystis paradoxa) 
 The bark of the trunk should be removed in the bleeding area and Bordeaux paste 
should be applied in this area 
 
Preparation of 1% bordeaux mixture 
 Copper sulphate @ 400g should be dissolved in 20 litres of water and 400 g of lime 
in another 20 litres of water separately. The copper sulphate solution should be added to the 
lime solution constantly stirring the mixture. Earthen or wooden vessels alone should be 
used and metallic containers should not be used. To find out whether the mixture is in 
correct proportion, a polished knife should be dipped in the mixture for one minute and taken 
out. If the re is reddish brown deposit of copper, additional quantity of lime should be added 
till there is no deposit in the knife. 
 
Preparation of bordeaux paste:  
 Take 200 g of copper sulphate and dissolve it in one litre of water and 200 g of lime 
in one litre o f water separately, both are mixed simultaneously in a third vessel and the 
resultant mixture can be used as a paste. 
 
 
SPECIAL PROBLEMS IN COCONUT 
 
Rejuvenation of existing garden 
 The low yield in vast majority of gardens is due to thick population, lack  of manuring 
and irrigation. These gardens could be improved if the following measures are taken. 
 
i. Thinning of thickly populated gardens 
    In the farmer‘s holdings where thick planting is adopted, many trees give an yield 
of less than 20 nuts/palm/year. By cutting and removal of these trees, the yield could be 
increased. Besides, there is saving in the cost of cultivation and increase in net profit. 
After removal of low yielding trees , the populations   should  be  maintained at 175  
palms/ha. 
ii. Ensuring adequate manuring and irrigation: 
  The yield can be increased in the  existing gardens when manuring + irrigation + 
cultural practice is adopted as per recommendation. 
 
 
       
220 
 
Pencil point disorder (Micronutrient deficiency) 
 Because of micronutrient deficiency,  the stem will taper towards its tip with lesser 
number of leaves. The lea f size will be greatly reduced and the leaves will be pal e and 
yellow in colour.  Along with the recommended fertilizer dose, 225 g  each of Borax, Zinc 
sulphate, Manganese sulphate, Ferrous sulphate, Copper sulphate and 10 g of Ammonium 
molybdate may be dissolved in 10 litres of water and poured in the basin of 1.8  m radius. 
This disorder can be corrected if noticed early.  Severely affected palms may be removed 
and replanted with new seedlings. 
 
Button shedding 
 Shedding of buttons and premature nuts may be due to any one of the following 
reasons: 
i) Excess acidity or alkalinity 
ii) Lack of drainage 
iii) Severe drought 
iv) Genetic causes 
v) Lack of nutrients 
vi) Lack of pollination 
vii) Hormone deficiency 
viii) Pests 
ix) Diseases 
The following remedial measures are suggested. 
 
Rectification of soil pH 
 Excess acidity or alkalinity  of soil may cause  button shedding.  If the soil pH is less 
than 5.5, it is an indication of excess acidity. This could be rectified by adding lime. Increase 
in alkalinity is indicated  by soil pH higher than 8.0. This situation could be rectified by 
adding gypsum. 
 
Providing adequate drainage facilities 
 Lack of drainage results in the roots of coconut trees getting suffocated for want of 
aeration. Shedding of buttons occur under such condition. Drainage channels have to  be  
dug  along  the contours to drain the excess water during rainy season. 
 
 
Management of young coconut gardens under waterlogged conditions 
(i) A trench between two rows of young coconut palms should be dug during onset of the 
monsoon rains. The size of the trench is 3 m width, 30 – 45 cm depth to entire length of 
field. The soil excavated from the trench should be placed along  the rows  of palms  to 
make a  raised bed. 
(ii) Form mound around the young palms to a radius of 1.2 m width with height of 30 –45 
cm. 
 
Genetic causes 
 In some trees button shedding may persist even after ensuring adequate manuring, 
irrigation and crop pest and disease management. This is an indication of inheren t defect of 
the mother  palm  from which the seed material was obtained. This underlines the need for 
proper choice of superior mother palm for harvesting seed coconut to ensure uniformly good 
yielding trees. 
 
Lack of nutrition 
 Button shedding occurs due to inadequate or lack of manuring. The recommended 
dose of manurial schedules and proper time of application are important to minimise  the  
button  shedding. Apply extra 2 kg of muriate of potash with 200 g of Borax/palm over and 
above the usual dosage of  fertilizer to correct the barren nuts in coconut for period of 3 
years. 
       
221 
 
 
Boron deficiency or crown choke disorder 
  Apply 200 g of borax/palm/year in two splits. 
 
 
Lack of pollination 
 Button shedding also occurs due to lack of pollination. Settin g up of beehives @ 15 
units/ha may increase the cross pollination in the garden. Further the additional  income  
obtained  through honey, increases the net profit per unit area. 
 
Hormone deficiency 
 The fertilised female flowers i.e., buttons  shed in some cases.  By spraying 2, 4- D at 
30 ppm or NAA 20 ppm (30 mg per litre of water) on the inflorescence one month after 
opening of the spathe, the setting percentage could be increased. 
 
Pests 
 Button shedding may happen due to the attack of bug. Spraying of systemic  
insecticides like Methyldematon 0.025% (1ml/lit) or Dimethoate 0.03% (1ml/lit) may reduce 
the occurrence. 
 
Diseases 
 Button shedding also occurs due to disease incidence such as basal stem rot. 
Adoption of control measures suggested for the disease reduce s not only spread of the 
disease but also prevents shedding of buttons. 
 
Coconut mother palm selection and nursery management 
The need for collecting seed materials from high yielding coconut palms is highly 
essential in a perennial crop like coconut. 
 
 
The following points may be remembered. 
 
 
Mother palm selection 
 
1. Select seed gardens, which contain large proportion of high yielding trees with uniformity 
in yielding ability. Trees growing closer to households,  cattle shed, compost pits and 
other favorable conditions should be avoided. 
2. High yielding mother  palms giving not less than 100 nuts/palm/annum should be chosen 
for collecting seednuts. Alternate bearers should be avoided. The age of the palm  
chosen be middle age i.e., from 25 to 40 years. Even trees with 15 years age can be 
selected, if it is high yielding and has stabilized yield. 
3. The mother palm should have straight  trunk, spherical  or semi spherical  crown,  high 
rate of  leaf and spathe production, short and stout petiole, more number of female 
flowers regular bearing habit, non – buckling bunches, high setting parentage, medium in 
nut size, high copra outturn and free from pest and diseases. A good regular bearing 
mother palm produces on an average one leaf and an inflorescence in its axil every 
month. So, there will be twelve bunches of varying stages of maturity at any one time. 
Avoid trees producing habitually barren nuts. 
4. Harvest seednuts during the months of February - August to get maximum germination 
and good quality seedlings. Harvest the bunches intended for seednut by lowering them  
to the ground using a rope to avoid injury to seednuts 
5. The seednuts should be round in shape and when tapped by finger should produce 
metallic sound. Fully ripe nuts develop twelve months after fertilisation. 
6. To get more quality seedlings, t he seednuts of tall and hybrid are to  be  air cured  for 
one  month followed by sand curing for two months. For dwarf varie ties, the air curing 
should be lesser than one month followed by sand curing for two months. 
 
 
       
222 
 
Nursery management 
 
1. Select nursery area in a well drained plot with coarse  texture soil near water source for 
irrigation. Nursery can be raised in the open space with artificial shade or in the adult  
coconut garden. 
2. Plant seednuts in long and narrow beds  at a s pacing of 30 x 30 cm either horizontally or 
vertically in deep trenches with 20 -25 cm depth. Five rows of nuts may be planted in each 
bed accommodating 50 nuts per row. 
3. Irrigate the nursery beds once in three days. 
4. Keep the nursery free of weeds. To manage  the weed problem in coconut nursery, 
growing sunnhemp 2 times (each harvested at flowering stage) followed by one hand 
weeding at 6 th month was found to be very effective besides yielding green manure for 
manuring the adult coconut palms. 
5. Provide shade to the nursery by raising Sesbania or Leucaena on the sides of beds. 
6. The seednuts start germination 6 – 8 weeks after planting and germination continues upto 
six months. Select seedlings that germinate before 5 months after planting. Remove those 
nuts which do not germinate 5 months after sowing. 
7. Regularly survey for pest and diseases 
8. Select seedlings 9 to 12 months after planting. Seedlings, which have germinated earlier , 
having good girth at collar and early splitting of leaflets, should be selected for pla nting. Do 
not select the so called Kakkamukku Pillai i.e. , seednuts which have just  germinated.  
Eliminate the seedlings which are deformed or having stunted growth. 
9. Remove the seedlings from the nursery by lifting with spade. Do not pull out the seedlings  
by pulling leaves or stem. 
10. Select quality seedlings with a minimum of 6 leaves and girth of 10 cm at collar.

7.  Arecanut  (Areca catechu L.) ; Palmae 
 
 
Varieties 
 Mangala, Sumangala, Subamangala, Mohitnagar, Srimangala, Samruthi (Andaman), 
Hirehalli dwarf, VTLAH 1, VTLAH 2 and Thirthahalli dwarf. 
 
 
Soil and climate 
 Arecanut is capable of growing in a variety of soils. It thrives best in well drained 
soils. Adequate protection from exposure to South -Western sun is essential to avoid sun -
scorch. Quick growing shade trees have to be planted on the southern and western sides 
well in advance of planting seedlings. It is sensitive to moisture deficit and should be grown 
where adequate water facilities are available. Grows in a wide range of temperature rang ing 
from minimum of 4 0C to a maximum of 40 0C. Altitude upto 1000 m above MSL. Rainfall – 
750 – 4500 mm. 
 
 
Season 
  June - December. 
 
Seeds and sowing 
 For raising seedlings seed nuts from pre -marked and pre -potent mother palms of 
outstanding performance are selected. Sown immediately after harvest at a spacing of 5 - 6 
cm apart in sand beds under partial shade with their stalk end pointing upwards. After the 
sprouts have produced two to three leaves (90 days old), they are transplanted to Secondary 
nursery beds at a spacing of 30 x 30 cm or  polythene bag of 30 x 10 cm filled with forest soil 
and are allowed to grow for 12 to 18 months under partial shade. Periodical watering should 
be given. 
 
 
Planting 
 Dwarf and compact seedlings with more number of leaves  of 1 – 2 years age should 
be selected. Plant in pits of 90 x90x90cm at a spacing of 2.75 m either way and covered with 
soil to the collar level and pressed around. Provide shade during summer months. Growing 
Banana or other crops in advance may also provide shade.  
 
 
Irrigation 
 Irrigate weekly once during November – February, once in 4 days during March – 
May. Flood irrigation 175 lit/ tree/ day. In drip irrigation 16 – 20 lit/ tree/ day.  
 
 
Manuring  
 Apply to each bearing palm (5 years and above) 10 - 15 kg of FYM or green leaf. 
100:40:140 g of NPK/ tree/ year. To palms less than five years old, half of the above dose is 
recommended. Manures are applied during January - February after the North - East 
monsoon in a basin of 0.75-1.00 m radius around the tree to a depth of 20 - 30 cm. 
 
 
After cultivation 
 Weeding is done twice or thrice in a year. Wherever the land is slopy terracing has to 
be done to prevent soil erosion.

8.  Oil Palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq); Palmae 
 
Varieties  
Dura, Tenera, Pisifera.  
 Tenera is the ruling hybrid and it is a cross between thick-shelled Dura and shell less 
Pisifera.  
 Tenera has a thin shell, medium to high mesocarp content and high oil content. 
 
Climate 
 Temperature is 210 C to 320 C with bright sunlight for at least 5 hours per day, annual 
rainfall- 200 cm with relative humidity - 75 – 100 % and Altitude – 450 -900 m above 
MSL.  
 
Soil 
 Moist deep, loamy soils, rich in humus with good water perm eability are suitable. Soil 
pH: 4 – 6.  
 
Nursery techniques 
 Fruits are separated from the bunch. Remove the exocarp and  mesocarp with knife. 
Dry the seeds on concrete or wooden floors under shade for 2 days and stored for 3 - 
9 months. Seeds are soaked in water for 5 days (changing the water daily) and 
spread out to dry for 24 hours.  
 Dried seeds are put in 250 guage thickn ess and 23 X 13 cm size polythene bags 
filled with top soil, sand and well decomposed cattle manure in equal proportions and 
placed for germination. Germination (90 -95 %) starts 10 -12 days. Apply fertilizer 
mixture containing 15:15:6 of NPK @ 8 g in 5 litres of water for 100 seedlings.  
 
Planting 
 Best season for planting is May - June i.e., during monsoon.  
 12 -14 months old healthy seedlings with 1-1.3 m height and 13 functional leaves are 
recommended for planting.  
 While planting, 143 plants per hectare s hould be maintained with a spacing of 9 m x 
9 m x 9 m (triangular planting). Planting should be done in pit size of 60 cm x 60 cm x 
60 cm (length, breadth and depth). Immediately after planting, form basin and give 
copious irrigation 
[[ 
 
 
Mulching 
 Mulching of oil palm basins is essential to conserve moisture as well as to control 
weeds. Empty bunches, male flowers, coconut husk, sugarcane trash can be used as 
mulch.  
 
Irrigation Management 
 
 Oil palm requires sufficient irrigation, as it has to grow with ass ured and adequate 
irrigation facility.  
 For grown up yielding palms of 3 years age and above, a minimum of 150 to 200 
litres of water per day is required. However, in older plantations during hot summer 
this quantity may be increased up to 300 litres. Basi n method of irrigation is to be 
taken up when irrigation water is not a constraint.  
 Drip or Micro sprinkler irrigation:  If drip irrigation is installed, four drippers are to 
be placed for each palm. Each dripper discharges 8 lit res of water per hour, 5 hour of 
irrigation per day is sufficient to discharge 160 lit/day.  
 
 
 
       
226 
 
Basin Management:  
 During first year, basins of 1-m radius, second year 2- m radius, and the third year 3 - 
m radius are to be taken around the palm by removing the soil from inside so tha t the 
soil will not accumulate at the collar region.  
 Basin area of oil palm represents its active root zone. Hence it must be kept clean 
and weed free to avoid competition for nutrients and water.  
 
Manuring 
  For five year old palm, apply 50 kg compost or FYM or green leaves.  
 
Fertilizer schedule: N: P: K: Mg SO4 (g/palm/year)  
 1st year = 400:200:400:125  
 2nd year = 800:400:800:250  
 3rd year onwards = 1200:600:1200:500 (2 equal split doses on July- Aug & Dec - 
Jan)  
 
Leaf pruning 
 Severe pruning will adversely affect both growth and yield of palm, cause abortion of 
female flowers and also reduce the size of the leaves.  
 It was suggested that the palms aged 4 – 7 years should retain 6 -7 leaves per spiral 
(48-56 leaves), those aged 8 – 14 years 5 -6 leaves pe r spiral (40 - 49 leaves) and 
those above 15 years should have 4-5 leaves per spiral (32 – 40 leaves).  
 
Ablation 
 Ablation is the removal of male and female flowers produced in the early stages of 
plantation. This enables the plant to gain adequate stem gir th, vigour and develop 
adequate root system.  
 Flowering starts from 14th to 18th month after planting. Start ablation immediately after 
the appearance of inflorescences on the palms. They can be removed easily by hand 
pulling or using the tool developed at  DOPR. Ablation can be extended up to 2 -1/2 to 
3 years depending upon the plant growth and vigour. Ablation is done at monthly 
intervals by pulling out the young inflorescence.  
 
Weeding 
 Take up regular weeding manually or with the use of only recommended herbicides.  
 Use preferably contact herbicides. Glyphosate (750ml/ha/ year or 17.5 ml/basin) is 
recommended for effective weed control.  
 Herbicide mixtures of Paraquat with Atrazine, Monuron and Diuron sprayed on 
ground, twice a year can control the weeds effectively.  
 
Intercropping 
 Oil palm is a wide spaced perennial crop with a long juvenile period of 3 years. Any 
remunerative crop can be grown, but the most suitable crops are vegetables, 
banana, flowers, tobacco, chillies, turmeric, ginger, pineapple etc.  
 While growing inter crops in mature oil palm gardens of 8 - 12 years age or palms 
attained a height of 3 met res, intercrops should be able to grow under partially 
shaded conditions and should not compete with oil palm for water, sunlight and 
nutrients (eg. cocoa, pepper, heliconia and ginger lilly).  
 Do not cut the oil palm fronds. Do not tie oil palm fronds close to the stem for inter -
cropping, which will reduce photosynthetic activity. Do not plough close to the palm 
base, which will cut the absorbing r oots and thereby reduce intake of water and 
nutrients.  
 Maximum number of green leaves should be retained on the palm.  
 
 
       
227 
 
Cover cropping 
  Pueraria phaeseoloides, Calopogonium muconoides, Centrosema pu bescens, 
Mimosa invisa, Mucana sp. 
 
Flowering  
 Oil palm comes to flowering 14 -18 months after planting. It produces both male and 
female flowers separately on the same palm. Male and female phases do occur 
naturally in consequent cycles in a palm.  
 
Pollination 
 Oil palm is a highly cross -pollinated crop. Wind and insects assist pollination, but 
wind pollination is not adequate.  
 Effective pollinating insects like Elaeidobius kamerunicus  helps in good pollination 
and fruit set. Release of this weevil after 2 -1/2 year of planting is advisable. If the 
plants are not having good girth and vigour, release the weevils after 3 years.

Pests 
 
Rhinoceros beetle 
  Trap the adults with fermented castor cake or pheromone bait. Use Bio agents like 
virus (Baculovirus oryctes) and Fungi ( Metarrihizium anisopliae). Treat th e compost pit with  
quinalphos @ 0.025 % to kill the young stages of pest.  
 
Red palm weevil 
  Removal of damaged and rotten bunches and apply tar to the wounds and cuts on 
the stem portion to avoid egg laying. Trap the adult beetles using pheromone baits.  
 
Diseases  
Bud rot   
 The affected crown should be removed and drenched with carbendazim or thiram @ 0.1

Basal stem rot  
 Removal and destruction of diseased palms  
 Apply 5 kg of neem cake/ tree/year 
  Root feeding with 10 g Aureofungin sol in 100 ml of water/tree/year 
 
Harvesting  
 First harvest can be done 3.5 to 4 years after planting. Few ripe fruits are loose/fall 
off indicates the bunch is ready for harvest. In Young palms, Chisel harvesting is followed. If 
palms become taller (from 10 th year onwards), then harvesting is done by hook. Harvesting 
rounds should be made as frequent as possible to avoid over ripening of bunches. 
Harvesting rounds of 10-12 days are generally practis ed. During rainy season harvesting 
rounds of 6-7 days are followed.  
 
Yield 
  25 – 30 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches/ ha

9.  Palmyrah (Borassus flabellifer); Palmae 
 
Varieties 
 SVPR – 1  
 
Soil 
 Arid, deep sandy & loamy soils are suitable. Dry areas with low rainfall are also ideal.  
 
Propagation 
  Seed. Germination of 63.25 % is achieved 6 weeks after sowing 
 
Seed sowing 
  Seed nut should be high yielder of padaneer & fruits, dwarf in stature, early and 
regular bearer, free from pest & diseases. Select matured fruit bunches and yellow tinch in 
stylar region. S eeds are stored in shade for 3 weeks. Shrunken, weight less and bored 
seeds are rejected. Seeds may be directly sown in situ or in nursery to raise the seedlings. 
For direct sowing, 3 – 4 whole fruits are planted in pits (20 x20x20cm) at 10 m apart and half  
filled with sand and soil mixture. Pit is covered with dried leaves. Sowing may be taken up 
during rainy months (November). Germination takes place within 3 weeks. 
 
Nursery transplanting 
 Seeds can be sown in mound formed by keeping sand to form a bed of 1 m broad, 
60 cm height or nursery beds built with bricks of 2 m broad, 60 cm height. Seeds are sown in 
10 cm space and covered with sand. About 1 y ear old seedling is lifted from the nursery and 
containerized in polythene bags. After rooting transplant in the main field. 
 
 
Spacing 
  3m x 3m (1,110 palms/ha) 
 
Manuring 
 Generally farmers adopt Sheep penning to the palm s. Application of 10 kg FYM/ pit 
before planting. Dosage may be increased biannually till reaching 60 kg FYM/tree/year 
 
 
After cultivation 
 Consists of gap filling; inter ploughing, basin rectification in the initial few years,. Gap 
filling may be carried out by using containerized seedlings. Basin rectification has to be done 
before rains; it helps collection and storage of rain water.  
 
 
Pruning 
  Pruning of 30 per cent leaves @ 10 per cent in phased manner. 
 
 
Intercropping  
Cowpea, moringa, gr eengram, redgram, bengalgram, ber, amla, pomegranate, west Indian 
cherry & guava can be intercropped.  
[ 
 
Growth and yield 
 Palmyrah is a slow grower. Fi rst frond appears in about 5 months. First fan shaped 
leaves appears only in the 2 nd year. When it attains the height of 12 – 18 m, comes to 
flowering (13 – 15 yrs) for padaneer (Sweet sap) purpose. Average of 100 – 200 lit obtained 
for a period of 4 month s from Feb – May. Padaneer and fruit yield are highly variable in 
individual palms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
229 
 
Tapping 
  Extraction of sap (Neera/ Padaneer) from inflorescence is called tapping. According 
to sex of the palm & age of the inflorescence, different kinds of tappings are available. 
 
Aripanai  
  In male palm , sheath covering the young inflorescence is removed and dried for 3 
weeks. End is cut every time & pot is tied (1- 1 ½ months). 
 
Vallupanai 
  One month old spikes are selected. Each male spike bearing sessile  flowers is 
pretreated by pressing and stroking & 3 - 6 such spikes are brought together, wrapped with 
leaves and fitted to a pot. 
 
Thattupalai  
  It has to be done in female palm to soften the tissue by hitting the inflorescence main 
axis with iron rod 
 
Kaivetty  
 Employed when the inflorescence is about 2 – 3 months old. Female palms are tapped for a 
longer period. i.e., April- Dec. and male for Dec – Feb. Sap is collected twice a day. Each 
time at the end of the collection of sap, a new cut surface is ma de by thin slicing. Tapped 
sap is called neera or padaneer.  
 
 
Yield 
 150 litres of padaneer / tree / year 
 24 kg jaggery/ tree / year 
 Jaggery recovery/litre of padaneer: 180 – 250 g of jaggery

10.  Betelvine (Piper betel); Piperaceae 
 
Varieties 
  Karpurakodi, Kall arkodi, Revesi, Karpuri, Vellai kodi, Patcha vethalai, SGM 1 and 
SGM (BV) - 2. 
 
 
Soil and climate 
  Well drained fertile clay loams are suitable. It does not tolerate saline and alkaline 
conditions. Betelvine require a cool shade, considerable humidity and regular supply of 
moisture in the soil. 
 
Propagation 
  The vines are propagated by terminal stem cuttings or setts of about 30 – 45 cm 
long. Setts obtained from the top portions of the vines are easy to root and hence best for 
planting. Number  of setts  is 1,00,000/ha. Setts with vigorous apical buds and nodal 
adventitious roots are selected and planted at the base of the live supports, which are to be 
planted 4 to 5 months earlier. 
 
 
Season 
  November - December and January - February. 
 
 
Field preparation and planting 
  The field is prepared to a fine tilth and beds of 2 m wide are formed to a convenient 
length. Provide drainage trenches of 0.5 m width and 0.5 m depth in between two adjoining 
beds. Sow the seeds of the live supports i.e. Agathi (Sesbania grandiflora ) in long rows. 
About 750 banana suckers are planted at the edges of the beds, which are used, for tying 
the vines on the live support and for pa cking the betel leaf. When the a gathi grow s to a 
height of about 4 m they are topped. The crop is planted in two rows in beds of 180 cm width 
on agathi plants with a spacing of 45 cm between plants in the row. 
 
 
Irrigation 
  Irrigate the field immediately after planting and afterwards once in a week. 
 
Training of the live standards 
  Before the establishment of vines, the side branches of Agathi trees upto a height of 
2 m are removed for early creeping of the vines. 
 
 
Training of the vines 
  Training is done by fixing the vine at intervals of 15 to 20 cm along the standards 
loosely with the help  of banana fibre. Training is done every 15 - 20 days depending upon 
the growth of vines. 
 
 
Lowering of vines: Under normal cultivation, the vines grow to height of 3 m in one year 
period. When they reach this height their vigour to produce normal size lea f is reduced and 
they need rejuvenation by lowering during March - April. After the vine is lowered , a number 
of tillers spring up from the nodes at the bends of the coiled vines at the ground level and 
produce many primary vines. After each lowering, irrigation should be given.

Chapter A 
14.  Medicinal Plants 
 
1.  Glory lily (Gloriosa superba); Colchicaceae 
Varieties  
         No named variety.   
 
Soil  
        Red soil with good drainage facility and pH range of 6.5 – 7.5.  Clayey soils are not 
suitable   for cultivation 
 
Climate  
  Dry climate, with an annual rainfall of 70 cm is suitable. 
 
Planting material 
  Propagation through ‗v‘ shaped tubers.  Select  disease free and healthy tubers 
weighing 40-60g. Sprouting is observed during July to August. 
 
Seed rate 
 2,000 kg tubers / ha.  Tubers have to be treated with 0.1%   carbendazim so lution by 
soaking for half an hour to avoid tuber rot.   
 
Season  
   July-August 
 
Field preparation 
    After ploughing the land, apply FYM @10t /ha. 
 
Spacing   
Planting is done in raised ridges prepared in east west direction.  The r idges shoud 
be 2 feet width and I foot height. The inter row distance should be 5.5 feet. Tubers have to 
be planted at 5-10 cm depth. 
 
Fencing  
Being a climber, glory lily needs support, which may be done using live standards 
(Commiphora beryii) or dead standards ( Dodonea viscosa) or by GI  wires. Care should be 
taken not to damage the tubers while laying the support.  
 
Nutrient management 
 Apply 120:50:75 kg of NPK  ha -1, (one third nitrogen, entire P and one third 
potassium as basal and the remaining nitrogen and potassium in two splits)   along with   
vermicompost 5t /ha + bioinoculants ( Trichoderma viride and Pseudomonas fluorescence @ 
2.5 kg/ha with  ZnSO 4 @ 25kg/ha, FeSO 4 @ 50 kg/ha, Borax @ 10 kg/ha, Sodium 
molybdate  @ 0 .5kg/ha at the time of planting. Foliar sprays  of FeSO4 (1%), ZnSO4, (0.5%)  
Borax (0.2%) twice @ 200 mg/kg at early and late flowering stage, have to be given. 
 
Irrigation 
 Irrigation is done immediately after planting and once in five days interval.  Weekly 
irrigation is essential at the time of flowering and pod set.    
 
       
234 
 
After cultivation 
 Care should be taken not to damage the growing tip.  Once the tip is damaged, the 
plant will not produce subsequent branches or laterals which will reduce the flowering and 
pod yield.   
 
Pollination 
 As self pollination percentage is low, assisted hand pollination is required. The 
mature stamens are collected and dusted on receptive stigma during early morning hours (7 -
11 am). The ideal stage of receptive stigma can easily be judged by the tricolour (green, 
yellow and scarlet) petal s. This method is followed by foliar application of 0.1 % boron + 0.5 
% zinc sulphate  at fortnightly intervals have to be done to induce higher seed set. 
 
Harvest 
 The crop duration is 180 days and pods can be harvested when the colour starts 
turning light yellow and when skin of the pods shrinks. After harvest, pods should be dried 
for 2-3 days to facilitate separation of seeds from locule. The seeds are dried again under 
open sun for 3 -5 more days until the seed moisture maintains to 6 -8 per cent. After drying, 
sand, stone and other unwanted particles have to be removed and the healthy seeds should 
be packed in bags. 
 
Yield 
 400-500 kg dry seeds/ha and 1000 kg tubers/ ha/ year

Varieties :  TNAU- medicinal coleus CO-1 
 
Soil                  
        Red sandy soil and sandy loam soil are highly suitable.  Soil drainage is essential and 
hard pan and water logged soils should be avoided. 
 
Climate  
       Suitable for plains and lower hills.  Requires 70 cm annual rainfall 
 
Propagation 
        Terminal three to four nodal cuttings measuring 10 cm length is used. Cuttings are 
planted at 60cm x 45cm spacing with total plant population of 37,000 plants per hectare.  
 
Land Preparation 
         Apply 15 t FYM/ha. Ridges are formed at a spacing of 60 cm. Cuttings have to be 
planted at a spacing of 45 cm.   
 
Nutrient management 
  The nutrients NPK @30:60:50 kg/ha have to be applied in two split doeses at 30 and 
45 days after planting.  In micronutrient deficient soils, ZnSO4 @ 25kg/ha can be applied as 
basal dose. 
 
 
Irrigation 
 Irrigate immediately after planting and later at weekly intervals. Withhold the irrigation 
ten days before harvest. 
 
Plant protection  
Diseases: 
 
The occurrence of wilt is becoming a major problem in coleus cultivation.  Pathogens 
associated with wilt and root rot are Fusarium chlamydosporum, Macrophomina phaseolina, 
Rhizoctonia solani   and Sclerotium sp coupled with inciden ce of root knot nematode 
Meloidogyne incognita. Due to these diseases, the yield loss is up to 50 to 60%. 
 
Management strategies for diseases 
 Select the coleus cuttings from disease free plants.

4. Geranium (Pelargonium graveolens (L) Hervitt.); Geraniaceae 
 
Varieties 
  Algerian, Reunion, IIHR-8, Kodaikanal 1, CIM Pawan, Hemanti, Bipuli and Egyptian. 
 
Soil and climate 
  A deep light porous well drained soil, rich in organic matter and acidic in reaction 
with a pH of 5.5 to 6.0 is suitable. An elevation ranging from 1 ,000 – 2,400 m with an annual 
rainfall of 100 to 150 cm evenly distributed throughout the year is ideal.  It thrives well in a 
sub tropical climate with a temperature ranging from 5  to 23  O C. However, temperature 
below 3O C kills the  
plants. 
 
Propagation 
  Geranium is propagated by stem cuttings. Cuttings of about 10 cm taken from 
current season growth with 3 - 4 nodes are raised in polythene bags of 10 x 10 cm size. 
Thorough field preparation leading to fine tilth is essential. Pits of 30 x 30  x 30 cm size are 
dug at a spacing of 45 x 45 cm and cattle manure at 250 g/pit is applied and rooted cuttings 
of 2 months age are planted during April - May.  
 
Manuring 
  FYM-25t/ha, 25:150:100 kg/ha in each of N, P and K is recommended. P and K are 
applied every year at the ti me of first harvest while N is applied in equal splits depending 
upon the number of harvests per year. Zinc Sulphate at 20 kg and Boron at 10 kg per ha 
basally once in a year during June-July improves the yield of herbage. Geranium also 
responds well to Copper and Molybdenum. 
 
Irrigation 
  Geranium is usually grown as a rainfed crop. Irrigation during dry periods increases 
the yield. 
 
After cultivation :   Weedings, uprooting and burning the diseased plants throughout the 
life cycle of the plant. From the s econd year onwards, give a deep soil forking around the 
plants to improve the growth of more suckers. 
 
Pruning :  Pruning of the bushes is necessary when the bush shows signs of decline. The 
branches are cut back leaving 15 - 20 cm once in 4 - 5 years. 
 
Plant protection 
Diseases: Wilt 
Drench with carbendazim @1 g/l  at monthly intervals. 
 
Nematode 
  To control the nematodes ( Meloidogyne hapla) in nursery, apply c arbofuran at 2 kg 
a.i./ ha once in 6 months in June and December. 
 
 
Harvest and distillation 
  In the first year of planting, only one harvest can be done at 7 - 8 months and 
thereafter 3 or 4 harvests can be done in a year. The tender tip portion with 6 - 12 nodes 
constitutes the materials for harvest. The harvested material is withered in shade for  two to 
three hours and distilled.

Soil and climate 
 Well drained loam or sandy loam soils rich in organic matter having pH between 6 
and 8.2 are ideally suited for its cultivatio n Sub-tropical areas receiving an annual rainfall of 
100 - 150 cm are good.  Japanese mint can be cultivated both in tropical and sub -tropical 
areas. The mean temperature of 20-400 C during major part of the growing period and 
annual rainfall of 100-110 cm, (light showers at planting stage and ample sunshine at the 
time of harvesting) are ideal. 
 
 
Propagation 
 Mint can be propagated vegetatively through root suckers and terminal cutting. 
 
Seed rate 
 On an average, 4 quintals of stolons are required for planting in one hectare of land. 
 
Preparation of field and planting 
  The field should be ploughed and harrowed thoroughly and divided into beds of 
suitable size to facilitate irrigation and make it free from weeds and stubbles. In each bed, 
lines are opened a t a distance of 4 0 x 40 cm depending upon the variety and inter -culture 
implement used. The furrows are opened a t 5 to 6 cm deep manually or through tractor 
driven harrow. Within a furrow, stolons are placed in rows at 10 cm. distance and furrows are 
closed with top soil. The bed is irrigated immediately after placing the stolons..  
 
Season of planting 
  June - July. 
Irrigation 
  Ten   irrigations are given during  summer season at intervals of  10-15 days, 
whereas another 4-6 for autumn crop harvested in late October.  
 
Manuring  
Basal 
  Apply NPK at 50:75:50 kg/ha. 
 Top dressing 
 Apply 30 kg N in 2 splits at 60th and 120th day after planting. 
  
       
245 
 
Weeding 
 Weeding with hand or mechanical hoes within the first six weeks of planting  and after 
that at an interval of about two to three weeks, after the first weeding. 
 
Crop rotation 
  The rotation of mint crop with other food crops is found to be a good way of 
controlling weeds. Continuous cropping of any of the mints is not adv isable.The best rotaion 
is Mint: Rice and Mint : Potatoes and Mint : Vegetables : Peas etc. depending upon cropping 
system followed in the region. 
 
 
 
Plant protection 
Pests 
 
Red pumpkin beetle 
  Spraying malathion @1ml/litre of water. 
 
Diseases 
Stolon rot 
 Treatment of the stolons with 0.25% c aptan or 0.1% b enlate or 0.3 % . agallol solution for 2 
to 3 minutes before planting is a preventive measure. 
 
Fusarium wilt 
  Application of 0.1% benlate or bavistin carbendazim 
 
Leaf blight 
  Application of 0.25% copper oxy chloride (2.5g/l)  
 
Harvest 
 First cutting starts in about 5 months after planting and subsequently at 3 months 
interval. The fresh herbage at harvesting stage contains 0.5 to 0.68% of oil and is ready for 
distillation after wilting for 6-10 hrs. The wilted crop is cut 10cm. above the gr ound by means 
of a sickle on bright sunny days, since harvesting on cloudy or rainy days decrease the 
menthol content in the oil. Under good management conditions, the crop will give economic 
yield for about four years.  
 
Yield 
 Herbage- 24 - 30 t/ha/year. Oil- 100-150kg/ha/year. 
 
Post harvest management 
 Storage of herbage 
  Mint herbage should be shade dried for about a day before it is distilled. Care 
should be taken that decomposition of the herbage does not initiate during the drying 
process. There wou ld be some reduction in oil yield if wilted herbage crop is stored for a 
longer period of 2 -3 days. As such, storage of herbage for a longer period is not 
recommended. 
 
 Distillation 
  The recovery of oil from the herb age is 0.5 -0.8%. Oil is    obtained thr ough steam 
distillation. The oil is of golden yellow colour, containing not less than 75% menthol. The 
duration of steam distillation is 2-2.5 hours for complete recovery of the oil. About 80% of the 
oil is received in the receiver in about one hour. The o il that is received later is richer in 
menthol.

Lifting, curing and storage of bulbs 
 
 Bulbs reach maturity at the cessation of flowering when the leaves become  yellow and 
dry during winter (February -March). At this stage, irrigation is withheld and the soil is 
allowed to dry.  
 The leaves are cut off at the ground level and the bulbs are dug out. After digging, the 
bulbs are lifted out and the adhering earth shaken off neatly and thoroughly.  
 The offsets are then separated out by hand, which are used as seed stock for the next 
season. The bulbs are then graded based on the size into mature (> 1.5 cm diameter) 
and immature (< 1.5 cm diameter).   
 Cleaned and graded bulbs are placed on shelves to dry or cure. To hasten curing 
artificial heat of 27° to 35°C may be applied.  
 The bulbs must be stirred or have their position changed every few days to prevent 
fungal attack and rotting.  
 Bulbs are stored in a protected shad y place with good aeration, till they are planted 
outdoors.  
 Storage temperature influences the number of bulbs produced and the quality of flower 
spike. An ambient air temperature of at least 18°C for four to six weeks or exactly six 
weeks at 30°C stimulates the yield of commercial sized bulbs.  
 Longer storage at 30°C advances flower spike yield but the quality of spike deteriorates 
and the bulb number decreases

Special practices 
 
Training 
          Early training is essential for plants under polyhouse conditions. Some of the first 
growth which consists of blind shoots must not be cut or bent, but left upright. Bu ds 
appearing at early stages are removed.  The second growth will come to flower again in four 
to five weeks. By then, the plants will be 50 to 60 cm high, which is necessary to have 
enough growing speed in the plant and to have enough foliage for bending.   
 
Bending 
        The first bending (basal formation) is done on 35 th day after planting. The main shoot is 
bent down so that lateral branches grow.  The second bending is done after 2 years to 
strengthen the plants. 
 
Shoot thinning 
        Periodically remove unproductive shoots and water suckers. 
 
Pruning 
       Pruning is followed only under open conditions during the months of March and 
October.  
 
Pinching 
       Pinching is done to regulate flowering. Most of the commercial cultivars take about five -
and-a-half to six weeks from pinching to produce flowers during summer and about eight 
weeks during winter.

Pinching 
 Depending upon the need of crop spread, single, one and a half or double pinch method 
is adopted. 
 Ideal time for pinching is early morning. 
 When the plant attains 5 nodes, the first pinch is given. This is called ‗single pinch‘. This 
would give rise to six lateral shoots. 
 With a ‗one and half pinch‘, 2-3 of these lateral shoots are pinched again. For the ‗double 
pinch‘, all the lateral shoots are pinched off.  
Disbudding 
  In standard carnations, side buds should be removed whereas in spray carnations, 
the terminal bud has to be removed.

20.  Drip irrigation for fruit crops 
 
Drip irrigation offers scope for enormous savings in water usage and it is the most 
useful system to boost horticultural production in areas with limited water resources. 
Research work carried out at TNAU indicates the saving in irrigation water ranges 
from nearly 40 to 68 per cent with an additional yield benefit of 14-98 per cent over the 
conventional irrigation methods. Drip irrigation can be thought of in rainfed areas with 
meager water resources available during the periods other than the rainy seasons. 
Most of the fruit crops require drip irrigation during the period of flowering to fruit 
development in order to increase the fruit set and improve the fruit size reflecting on final 
yield. However, the drip irrigation has to be dispensed 10 – 15 days before the expected 
harvesting period in order to improve the sweetness of the fruits. Daily water 
requirement of various fruit crops is given below: 
 
Crops 
 
Water requirement (lit/day/plant) 
Mango 30-50 
Banana 20-25 
Citrus 22-30 
Guava 22-30 
Sapota 20-30 
Amla 15-25 
Grapes 15-25 
Papaya 15-25 
 
  
For the young trees which are in their pre bearing stage, 1/3rd of the recommended dose 
of water may  be given and slowly increased to  reach the above level during full 
bearing.

21.  Organic Cultural Practices 
FRUIT CROPS 
 
 Organic farming is a method of farming which avoids or largely excludes the 
use of harmful chemicals such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides and 
use of natural resources such as organic matter, minerals and microbes to maintain 
the environment clean, ecological balance and to provide stability to the production level 
without polluting soil, water and air. Organic farming system relies on large-scale 
application of animal wastes or farmyard manure, compost, crop rotation, crop 
residues, green manure, vermicompost, bio-fertilizers, VAM, bio-pesticides and  
biological control. The primary requirement for organic manuring sources are 
presented below:

24.  IMPORTANT PLANT NUTRIENTS, THEIR DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS 
AND REMEDIAL MEASURES 
 
Most of the nutrients required for plant growth and development are usually present in 
the soil itself. C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S are macronutrients because these are 
needed in large amounts. Out of macronutrients C, H, O is available in gaseous form 
and there is no dearth of these basic nutrients. D ry matter of plant contains over 95% 
of these elements. All the nutrients present in the soil may not be easily available for 
absorption by the plant roots. Some secondary nutrients (micronutrients) are also 
required for maintaining the growth and producti vity of fruit trees/plants. These are 
Fe, Zn, Cu, Bo, Mo, and CI. In fruit crops, the deficiency of micronutrients causes 
many more disorders than that of macronutrients.  
 
MACRONUTRIENTS 
Nitrogen (N): 
Nitrogen is a constituent of amino acids, amides, prot eins, enzymes, vitamins, 
coenzymes and plant hormones. It imparts vigour to the plant and dark green colour 
to the foliage. Nitrogen is required for cell division and respiration. It delays plant 
maturity due to which tissues remain succulent in nature. Ni trogen also governs the 
utilization of phosphorus, potassium and other essential elements. It is a very mobile 
element. 
Deficiency symptoms:  Chlorosis begins in older leaves. Tips and margins of leaves 
commonly become yellow first. I n severe deficiency yo ung leaves also become 
yellow. In bearing fruit trees flowering and fruiting get reduced.  Early crop maturity 
and low production. 
Remedial measures: Foliar spray 500 g of Urea dissolved in 100 lit of water  
 
Phosphorus (P): 
Phosphorus is component of sugar  phosphates, nucleic acids, nucleotides, 
coenzymes, phospholipids and phytic acid etc. It is mostly found in younger parts viz. 
flowers, maturing fruits and seeds. It enhances crop maturity, root growth, activity of 
rhizobia and formation of nodules in legumes. It plays a key role in reactions involving 
ATP and cell division. Phosphorus is required in photosynthesis and carbohydrate 
break down and transfer of energy within plant. 
Deficiency symptoms: 
Normally P deficiency has not been observed in fruit tree s. The leaves become small 
with dull green colour the leaves turn bronze coloured later on. Since P is mobile in 
plants, hence, deficiency symptoms appear on old leaves first. On acute P deficiency 
purple pigment (due  to anthocyanin development) may develo p on the back side of 
the leaf lamina. Stunted shoot growth and poor root development.  
Remedial measures: Use 40-60 g SSP per plant as soil application 
Potassium (K): 
Potassium improves the efficiency of sugar use in plant system. It helps the plants to 
overcome the stresses due to environment like frost tolerance by decreasing the 
osmotic potential of cell sap. K regulates the supply of CO 2 by controlling opening of 
stomata. Young leaves, shoot tips and meristematic tissues are rich in K. It is 
involved in cell division. K is helpful in the fixation of nitrogen by legumes. It improves 
the colour, flavour and fruit size. 
 
       
327 
 
 
Deficiency symptoms: 
Potassium is mobile in plants hence deficiency appears on recently matured leaves. 
Acute K deficiency causes leaf b urning from margins and tip. Leaves turn brown in 
colour and then become scorched. Shoots become thin, plants show stunted growth. 
In mandarins older leaves show mosaic pattern of green and yellow (speckled 
appearance).  
In banana, K deficient plants are s hort, slim and deformed as a consequence of poor 
fruit filling caused by reduced photosynthesis and sugar transportation. 
Remedial measures:  Foliar spray 500 g of Muriate of Potash or Sulphate of Potash 
dissolved in 100 lit of water. 
Calcium (Ca): 
Calcium is present in leaves as calcium pectate. Calcium is required as a cofactor by 
some enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of ATP and phospholipids. It is very 
important for chromosome flexibility and cell division. Calcium helps in the uptake of 
N, Fe, Zn, Mn and Boron. Good calcium nutrition is a pre-requisite for healthy orchard 
particularly citrus. 
Deficiency symptoms: 
Calcium deficiency causes dwarfing of plants. Twigs may die, leaves abscise. There 
may be a growth of multiple buds. Leaves become small and  show yellowing. Fruits 
crack, root growth is restricted and roots may rot. Undersized and misshapen fruits in 
citrus are the major cause of calcium deficiency. The juice vesicles get shriveled. 
Softening of tissues and cell wall breakdown is common in fruits. Fruit quality will be 
affected with the occurrence of blossom-end rot on fruits (Tomato). In grapes, a black 
sunken spot develops at the blossom -end of the berry which later on spreads with 
water-soaked region around it. Defective calcium nutrition an d assimilation appear to 
be the cause for blossom end rot of fruits.  
Remedial measures: Foliar spray of 1.0 per cent calcium nitrate or apply  2 to 4 kg of 
lime once in two years to each plant. 
 
Magnesium (Mg): 
Magnesium is constituent of chlorophyll and p rotoplasm. It is involved in 
photosynthesis. It is an activator of many enzymes. Mg is required non -specifically by 
large number of enzymes involved in phosphate transfer. It is essential for formation 
of carbohydrates, fats and vitamins. It also stimulate s phosphorus uptake and 
transport. 
 
Deficiency Symptoms: 
Magnesium is very mobile hence the deficiency symptoms first appear in older 
leaves. The most common symptom is yellowing of leaf margins and then lamina, 
commonly referred as bronzing or copper leaf . The yellowing starts from the base 
along the mid ribs of mature leaves. The yellow area enlarge and unite, only the tip 
and the base of the leaf remain green, showing an inverted v -shaped wedge area 
pointed on the midrib. Extreme Mg -deficiency cause the plants may become 
defoliated completely, while limbs with little or no fruit may not show any deficiency 
symptom. This is particularly so in citrus.  Remedial measures: Foliar Spray 100 g of 
Magnesium sulphate in 100 lit of water or apply 25 - 125 kg of Magnesium sulphate to 
the soil. 
 
Sulphur (S): 
Sulphur is present in sufficient quantity in leaves. It is a component of cystine, 
methionine, proteins and fatty acids. Sulphur is also a constituent of lipoic acid 
coenzymes-A, thiamine, pyrophosphate, glutathio ne, biotin, adenosine -5′- 
phosphosulphate and 3′ Phosphoadenosine -5′-phosphosulphate. Sulphur retards 
protein synthesis, imparts hardness and vigour to the plants. 
       
328 
 
Deficiency symptoms: 
Sulphur is slightly mobile in the plant system. Symptoms appear on new leaves. 
Plants remain stunted and pale green to yellow in colour. Sulphur does not move 
readily from old to new leaves like N. Leaf area and fruiting is reduced. Leaves fall 
early. The leaf chlorosis exhibited by S -deficiency usually resembles nitrogen 
deficiency. 
Remedial measures: Foliar spray of K2SO4 or CaSO4 @1% twice at fortnightly 
interval. Apply Gypsum@ 100 kg /acre in soil and use sulphur containing  fertilizers 
e.g. SSP.  
 
MICRONUTRIENTS 
The micronutrients such as Iron, Manganese, Boron, Copper, Zinc, Molybdenum, 
Chlorine and Silicon,  etc., are extremely essential for sustained growth and 
productivity. Their essentiality is there  for both seasonal and perennial crops, and 
their shortage quite apparently manifests in visible  deficiency symptoms 
characterized by stunted growth, narrow or little leaves, chlorosis, crinkling, cupping 
and other leaf deformities, flower drop, alteration of sex of flowers, poor 
pigmentation and quality, cracking of stem, die back and oozing of gum. Each 
micronutrient is capable of producing one or more specific deficiency symptoms if it 
is in short supply to the plant metabolism.  Often the complex deficiency symptoms 
as a result of deficiency of more than two micronutrients are manifested in  sensitive 
crops such as Limes, Sweet Oranges, Mandarins and Lemons, etc.  
  
Iron (Fe): 
Among the micro -nutrients iron is abundantly present in soils. Iron is a constituent of 
cytochromes and non -haeme iron proteins. It acts as a catalyst in the formation of 
chlorophyll and co -factor of  several enzymes. It helps in various reactions of 
respiration, photosynthesis and reduction of nitrates and sulphates. It has a role in N2-
fixation also. The improved Fe - polyflavonoid activity enhances the biosynthesis of 
pigments like xanthophylls and carotenoids on fruits and vegetables. 
Deficiency symptoms: Iron deficiency causes chlorosis in young leaves. In severe 
cases the fine network of veins is distinctively green and lamina become yellow. Twig 
die back due to Fe deficiency is most common in citr us. Acute deficiency causes 
swelling of leaves and leaf abscission. The Fe-deficiency is difficult to distinguish from 
Manganese deficiency. 
Remedial measures: Foliar Spray 250 - 500 g of Ferrous sulphate dissolved in 100 lit 
of water. 
 
Citrus 
Symptoms: Pale yellow and small sized leaves, stunted growth and small sized fruits. 
Remedy: Foliar spray of 0.1 % Ferrous sulphate, 2-3 times at weekly intervals. 
Grapes: Iron deficiency in grapes is due to the presence of excess Calcium in the 
soil. 
Symptoms: Pale yellow small leaves with stunted growth. 
Remedy: Foliar spray of 0.1% Ferrous sulphate, one before bloom and the second 
after fruit set 
 
Pineapple:  The deficiency is prevalent in the soils with more Calcium and 
Magnesium. 
Symptoms:  Reddish green leaves. 
Remedy:  0.1% Ferrous sulphate sprayed with an interval of one month. 
 
Pomegranate: Pomegranate responds well to foliar application of iron.  
       
329 
 
 
Remedy: Ferrous sulphate 0.4 % prior to flowering, at full bloom and at fruit set 
increases the yield of fruits. C ombined foliar application of 0.25 % each of sulphates 
of zinc, ferrous and manganese with 0.15% boric acid increased the yield and juice 
content. 
 
Vegetables: Iron is essential for the initial growth of vegetable crops. So it is essential 
to apply Iron  containing fertilizers at the initial stage of development to avoid iron 
deficiency in vegetable crops. Iron deficiency is common in crops like Beans, 
Cauliflower, Beetroot, Brinjal, Tomato and Tapioca. 
Remedy: Apply 25 kg Ferrous sulphate per ha as soil application or foliar spray 0.5 % 
Ferrous sulphate solution 3 - 4 weeks after sowing/transplanting. 
 
Tomato  
Symptoms: Marginal and interveinal scorching develops on the young expanded 
leaves with slight purpling of the petioles and veins of chlorotic young l eaves. 
Degreening of the smallest veins and irregular development of brown patches is also 
seen over the lamina. 
 
Brinjal 
Symptoms: Young as well as older leaves will exhibit chlorotic symptoms in the form 
of yellowing and there is a decline in photosynthe sis due to which fruit yield will be 
greatly reduced.  
Remedy: Foliar spray of solution containing 500g of ferrous sulphate and 100 g of 
urea dissolved in 100 lit of water added with 100 ml of soap solution for an acre of 
land is taken up two or three time s at an interval of 20 days depending upon the 
degree of severity, to manage the deficiency. 
 
Zinc (Zn) 
Zinc deficiency is the most widespread and limiting growth and yield in fruit crops. It 
commonly affects banana, custard apple and mangoes. Problems oft en appear in 
spring when crops are growing quickly but have difficulty in absorbing nutrients from 
cold soil. 
Deficiency symptoms: 
Zinc is important for the formation and activity of chlorophyll and in the functioning of 
several enzymes and the growth horm one, auxin. The severe stunting of leaves and 
shoots, which is so typical of zinc deficient crops, is a consequence of low auxin 
levels in tissue. Young leaves are usually the most affected and are small, narrow, 
chlorotic and often rosette due to failure of the shoot to elongate. Bloom spikes are 
small, deformed and drooping. In young pine apple plants, zinc deficiency is indicated 
by the young heart leaves bunching together and then tilting horizontally. This 
condition is commonly called crook neck. 
 
Citrus  
Deficiency symptoms: Zinc deficiency is also known as mottle leaf and indicates 
yellow blotches between veins or terminal shoot leaves, reduced leaf size, narrow 
pointed and chlorotic leaves and appearance of small green spots in yellowed areas, 
but veins remaining green followed by small sized and misshapen fruits. Internodes 
are short giving the shoot a rosette look and the fruits become small and hard with 
reduced yield.  
Remedy: Foliar spray of zinc sulphate 0.3% with calcium chloride 0.5g/litre, su crose 
0.5g/ litre and urea 5g/litre once for a young tree and twice for old trees at fortnightly 
intervals corrects Zn deficiency very effectively.  
 
Mango 
       
330 
 
Deficiency symptoms: The major nutritional disorder in mango is little leaf caused by 
the deficiency of zinc. This leads to stunted growth of roots, shoots and leaves. The 
lamina of leaves turn pale yellow while midrib remains green. Leaves become very 
small, little with interveinal 
chlorosis. Yellowing, necrotic patches develop on old leaves with drying  of leaves. In 
severe deficiency, flushing may stop and twigs or even whole branches die back. 
Subsequently necrotic patches turn grey and cover the entire surface.  
Remedy :  Foliar sprays of 1 -2% Zinc sulphate, one at the time of flowering and the 
other at one month after the first spray correct the deficiency. 
 
Grapes 
Deficiency symptoms: Small leaves (little leaf) or rosette, widened petioles and small 
sized fruits are the major symptoms. In some varieties, clusters become stagger and 
the size of berrie s range from very small with one or two seeds to normal sized ones 
with normal seed development.  
Remedy: Smearing 10 % zinc sulphate on the pruned stem or spraying of 0.5 – 1% 
zinc sulphate 10 days before flower formation is the control measure. 
 
Guava 
Deficiency symptoms: Small leaf and leaf chlorosis are the major symptoms of 
deficiency. Interveinal chlorosis was also observed with reduction in leaf size. Die 
back, scant flowering, drying and cracking of the fruits are other symptoms.  
Remedy: Deficiency can be corrected with foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulphate 15 days 
before flowering. 
 
Beans 
Deficiency symptoms: Dropping of leaves and flower buds and interveinal chlorosis. 
 
Tomato 
Deficiency symptoms: Stunted growth, thickening of leaves, interveinal chlorosis, 
shortened internode, dropping of flowers and immature fruits. 
 
Radish 
Deficiency symptoms:  Interveinal chlorosis at the initial stage and drying of leaves at 
later stages. 
 
Onion 
Deficiency symptoms: Tip drying during initial stage and total drying of leaves at later 
stages. 
Remedial measures 
 Foliar Spray of 0.25 - 0.50 % Zinc sulphate solution in the nursery five weeks 
  after germination. 
  Foliar application of 0.5 % Zinc sulphate in the field. 
 
Boron (B): 
It is immobile in plant system. It plays  a role in flowering, pollen germination, pollen 
tube growth and fruiting. It helps in the translocation of sugars from leaves to 
enhance photosynthesis. Boron also acts as a catalyst in physiological processes viz, 
cell division, differentiation and deve lopment. Its  essentiality is obvious in  Potato, 
Tapioca, Cabbage, Grapes, Citrus, Tomato and Guava. 
 
General deficiency symptoms: 
The terminal buds fail to sprout and twigs show die back. Terminal leaves turn 
necrotic, shed prematurely -rosetting and apical  meristems turn black. Leaves are 
dark green, boat like, brittle and fall early. Fruits show gummy granules in the fruit 
       
331 
 
albedo with hard fruits. Seeds fail to develop with deposits around the fruit axis. The 
skin of citrus the fruit become hard. In some citrus cultivars fruits may crack. 
 Boron toxicity prevalent in lemon and grapefruits. In lemons the leaf tips burn and 
base of this burn is at right angle to the midrib. In grapefruit scattered yellow spots on 
the upper leaf surface and gummy spots on the lower surface and edge or tip burn is 
seen. Premature wilting in trees occur inspite of sufficient moisture in the soil. 
 
Mango 
Deficiency symptoms:  Drying of leaves. This is more prevalent in the orchards, which 
are nearer to brick factories. 
Remedy: Either by soil application of 500g Borax per plant or by foliar spray of 0.3 % 
boric acid. 
 
Citrus 
Deficiency symptoms:  Red spots on newly emerged leaves, leaves become dry and 
brittle 
Remedy :  Foliar spray of 0.2 % boric acid 10 -15 days before flowering cor rect the 
deficiency 
 
Guava 
Deficiency symptoms: Splitting of fruits, gummosis at the splitted area, rough skin of 
the fruits. 
Remedy: Foliar spray of  0.2 % boric acid 10 -15 days before flowering correct the 
deficiency. 
 
Grapes 
Deficiency Symptoms: Small sized fruits. Presence of small sized fruits and large 
sized fruits in the same bunch is known as ―Hen and Chicken‖ disorder.  The fruits are 
sour in taste. 
Remedy: Foliar spray of 0.2 % boric acid a week before bloom and another at full 
bloom control the disorder effectively 
 
Cabbage 
Deficiency symptoms: Leaves become crinkled, rough and brittle. Drying of leaf 
edges soft spots on the petioles and loose heads. In hybrid cabbage varieties, heads 
will not be formed and the leaves become blue in colour. 
 
Cauliflower 
Deficiency symptoms: Browning of leaf margin in young buds. Pale yellow veins and 
drying of leaves, the flower heads are long and dried with hollow flower stalk. 
 
Radish 
Deficiency symptoms: Tip drying, pale yellow leaves at initial stages and bluish 
green leaves at later stages.  The leaves become crinkled and brittle. Early flowering 
occur. 
 
Carrot 
Deficiency symptoms: Wilting of plants despite enough soil moisture in the field.  
Deformed leaves with pale yellow colour. 
 
Potato 
Deficiency symptoms: Leaves become small and it resembles virus disease infected 
plant.  30 - 40 % yield loss and sometimes 100 % loss may occur. 
Remedial measures for vegetables to correct Boron deficiency 
 For Cabbage, Cauliflowe r, Tomato, Chillies, application of 40 g Borax  per 
       
332 
 
cent   area as soil application in nursery will produce elite seedlings. 
 Soil application of Borax 0.6 kg to 1.2 kg per ha is applied as fertilizer in the 
main   field. For root and tuber crops apply Borax @ 1.2 kg to 3.2 kg/ha. 
 Foliar spray of 0.2 % boric acid to correct boron deficiency. 
 
Manganese (Mn): 
Manganese accumulates in leaves more than in seeds. It is required for 
photosynthetic evolution of O 2, nitrogen meta bolism, chlorophyll synthesis and 
breakdown. It is required for the activity of so me dehydrogenase, decarboxylase, 
kinase, oxidase, peroxidase, and non -specifically by other divalent cation activated 
enzymes. It is also required for ascorbic acid synthesis. Mn is involved in the 
production of amino acids and proteins. 
Deficiency symptoms: Deficiency symptoms appear soon after the leaf is fully 
expanded and persists for long. Young leaves become chlorotic just like in Zn 
deficiency, with the only difference that there is no rosetting. The younger leaves 
show mottled chlorosis with green v eins and mesophyll tissue yellow or white this 
may spread to old leaves. Mn deficiency also resembles Fe deficiency, with only 
difference that the area near the veins remains green in Mn deficiency. With severe 
deficiency, develops light green to dull pale  green splotches between main lateral 
veins. 
 
Sugar beet 
Deficiency symptoms: Speckled yellows - Chlorosis between leaf veins, inward 
curling of leaves 
 
Pea 
Deficiency symptoms: Marsh spot- Brown area in centre of seed 
 
Apple 
Deficiency symptoms: Little leaves-Small, malformed leaves shortened internodes 
Remedy: Foliar Spray of 0.5% MnSO4, 2-3 times at weekly intervals 
 
Copper (Cu) 
Copper is essential for photosynthesis, for the functioning of several enzymes, in 
seed     development and for the production of lignin which gives physical strength to 
shoots and    stems. 
General Deficiency Symptoms: Stunted growth, rosetting and dieback of young twigs in 
fruit trees. White tipped  leaves are early symptoms. Reproductive  growth strongly 
affected leading to sterility. 
 
Banana 
Deficiency Symptoms: Leaf bud is crinkled and twisted. Delay in flower emergence. 
 
Coconut 
Deficiency Symptoms: Stunted growth, non-splitting of leaves. 
 
Citrus 
Deficiency Symptoms: Die back, exanthema, splitting  of bark, gummosis from fruits 
and browning of fruits with rough skin. 
 
Mango 
Deficiency Symptoms: Tip burning of old leaves with grey brown patches is the typical 
symptom of copper deficiency 
 
Grapes 
       
333 
 
Deficiency Symptoms: Small green foliage, rough bark, short canes with short 
internodes, poor root development and reduced yield with inferior quality berries 
Remedial measures: Foliar application of 0.5% Copper sulphate solution between 
bloom and two weeks after bloom controls the disorder. 
 
Molybdenum (Mo) 
Molybdenum functions in enzyme nitrate reductase which is responsible for reduction 
of nitrate to nitrite during N assimilation in plants. Although molybdenum deficiency is 
observed in many soils and pasture legumes, vegetables and occasionally cereals, it 
is very rare in fruit crops. 
General Symptoms:  Chlorotic interveinal mottling of the lower leaves followed by 
marginal necrosis and  in folding  of the leaves. In  severe conditions necrosis and 
wilting of leaves occur. 
Flower formation is inhibited, and if flowers do form, they abscise before setting fruits. 
 
Cauliflower 
Cauliflower requires high molybdenum. It is an indicator crop for this nutrient. 
Deficiency symptoms: Drying of leaves from  its edges at initial stages, later stages 
total drying. Leaves become long and narrow and this disorder is known as ‗Whip tail‘ 
in Cauliflower. 
 
Tomato 
Deficiency symptoms: Mottling of older leaves followed by scorching of margins and 
in rolling is often noticed due to deficiency. Extensive flower drop and death of 
growing point are very often noticed due to Mo deficiency. 
 
Cucumber 
Deficiency Symptoms: The plants are stunted and the leaves show pale or yellow 
green colour along the edge and between the veins followed by marginal scorching. 
Reduction in leaf size, shortened internodes and death of olde r leaves and poor fr uit 
development are the typical symptoms of Mo deficiency. 
 
Peas 
Symptoms: Mottling of leaves accompanied by death of most of the interveinal leaf. 
Yellowing of older leaves and curving upwards from the margins resulting in cup 
shaped a ppearance also occur. Flowering and fruiting reduced considerably.  
Remedial measures: Foliar spray of 625 g Ammonium molybdate in 400 lit of water 
before flowering. 
 
Chlorine (Cl) 
Chlorine is involved in the evolution of O 2 in primary reactions of photosyn thesis, cell 
multiplication and turgor production in guard cells. 
Deficiency symptoms: 
Chlorine deficient plants show chlorosis, necrosis and bronze discoloration of leaves. 
Plants show wilting. 
Remedial measures: Add Chlorine compound salts to soil. 
 
Foliar application:  
The deficiency of macro and micronutrients can be corrected by either soil or 
foliar application.  Since soil application is often encountered with the problems 
such as fixation, leaching, absorption and antagonism, foliar application has been 
a standard practice of application of micronutrients to plants.  Since the 
micronutrients are needed in very small quantity, the spray solution employed for foliar 
application is normally in terms of parts per million (ppm) or in percentage  and the 
       
334 
 
chemical to be so employed is to be in neutralized form, or else scorching of leaves 
may occur or may prove toxic to plant system. 
 Employ right micronutrients in right concentration by consulting the experts. 
Mixing   of two or more micronutrients to correct  multiple micro nutrient 
deficiencies is   recommended. 
 Take up spray preferably to young expanding foliage to ensure effective  
  absorption.  
 Saline and alkaline water should not be employed for preparing micronutrient 
spray   solution. Avoid spraying during blossom period. 
 Spray preferably during morning or evening. 
 Do not mix plant protection chemicals with micronutrients. 
 Wash and clean the sprayer, nozzle with clean water after spraying to 
avoid corrosion and clogging.

25.  MUSHROOM CULTIVATION 
 
Agriculture will continue to be the main strength of Indian economy. With the variety 
of agricultural crops grown today, we have achieved food security by prodding about 
240 million tonnes of food grains. However, our struggle to achieve nutritional security 
is still on. In future, the ever increasing population, depleting agricultural land, 
changes in environment, water shortage and need for quality food products at 
competitive rates are going to be the vital issues and secondary agricultural vocati ons 
are going to occupy a prominent place to fill the void quality food requirements. The 
demand for quality food and novel products is increasing with the changes in life style 
and income. To meet these challenges and to provide food and nutritional secur ity to 
our people, it is important to diversify the agricultural activities in areas like 
horticulture. Diversification in any farming systems imparts sustainability. Mushrooms 
are one such component that not only impart diversification but also help in 
addressing the problems of quality food, health and environmental sustainability. The 
present century is going to be a century of functional foods from synthetic chemicals 
and mushroom cultivation fits very well into this category and is going to be an 
important vocation. 
 
Mushrooms represent microbial technology that recycles agricultural residues into 
food and manure. It is solid state fermentation system in which crop residues are 
converted into valuable food rich in microbial protein. These are important source of 
quality protein, minerals and various novel compounds of medicinal value, do not 
compare for land and have very high productivity per unit area and time. These are 
considered to be the highest protein per unit area and time due to utilization of 
vertical space and short crop cycle. Due to their cultivation under controlled 
conditions the water requirements is less than any other crop grown in the field and 
has all the potentials of being a major crop in coming years. 
 
Mushroom farming today is bei ng practiced in more than 100 countries and its 
production is increasing at an annual rate of 6 -7%. In some developed countries of 
Europe and America, mushroom farming has attained the status of a high -tech 
industry with very high levels of mechanization a nd automation. China leads in 
mushroom production and China alone is reported to grow more than 20 different 
types of mushroom at commercial scale and mushroom cultivation has become 
China‘s sixth largest industry. The USA is the second largest producer of  mushroom 
sharing 16% of the world output. Presently, three geographical regions - Europe, 
America and East Asia contribute to about 96% of world mushroom production. With 
the rise in the income level, the demand for mushrooms at very low costs with the 
help of seasonal growing, state subsidies and capturing the potential markets in the 
world with processed mushrooms at costs not remunerative to the growers in other 
mushroom producing countries. 
 
Commercial production of edible mushrooms represents unique ex ploitation of the 
microbial technology for the bio conversion of the agricultural, industrial, forestry and 
household waste into nutritious and proteinaceous food. Our country can emerge as 
       
336 
 
a major player in mushroom production in wake of availability of p lenty of agricultural 
residues and labour.Integrating mushroom cultivation in wake of availability of plenty 
of agricultural residues and labour. Integrating mushroom cultivation in the existing 
farming systems will not only supplement the income of the fa rmers but also will 
promote proper recycling of agro -residues thereby improving soil health and 
promoting organic agriculture. In India, mushroom research started in1960s and the 
cultivation picked up in 1970s and new varieties were evolved in button and o yster 
mushroom during 1980s and 1990s. Since the year 2000, our country is progressing 
keeping in pace with global growth by developing technologies for cultivation of 
medicinal mushrooms. 
                India has varied agro -climate, abundance of agricul tural residues and 
plenty of manpower making it suitable for cultivating different mushrooms. Our 
country produces about 600 million tonnes of agricultural waste per annum and a 
major part of it is let out to decompose naturally or burnt in situ. This can effectively 
be utilized to produce highly nutritive food such as mushrooms and spent mushroom 
substrate can be converted into organic manure and vermi -compost. Mushrooms are 
grown seasonally as well as in state -of-art environment controlled cropping rooms all 
the year round in the commercial units. Mushroom growing is a highly labour oriented 
venture and labour availability is no constraint in the country and two factors, that is, 
availabilities of raw materials and labour make mushroom growing economically  
profitable in India. Moreover, scope for intense diversification by cultivation of other 
edible mushrooms like oyster, shiitake, milky and other medicinal mushrooms are 
additional opportunities for Indian growers. 
 
At present, four mushrooms viz., Button mushroom ( Agaricus bisporus ), Oyster 
Mushroom ( Pleurotus spp), Paddy straw mushroom ( Volvariella spp.) and Milky 
mushroom (Calocybe indica) have been recommended for round the year cultivation 
in India. 
 
India produces about 600 million tonnes of agricultu ral by products, which can 
profitably be utilized for the cultivation of mushrooms. Currently, we are using 0.04% 
of these residues for producing around 1.29 lakh tons of mushrooms of which 85% is 
button mushroom. India contributes about 3% of the total wo rld button mushroom 
production. Even if we use 1% of the residues for mushroom production, we can 
produce 3.0 million tons of mushrooms, which will be almost equal to current global 
button mushroom production (current world production 3.4 million tons). To  remain 
competitive it will be important to harness science and modern technologies for 
solving the problems of production and bio –risk management. Mushroom being an 
indoor crop, utilizing vertical space offers a solution to shrinking land and better water  
utility. 
 
Mushrooms have been reported to be capable of transforming agro wastes like paddy 
straw into protein rich food and have been confirmed to be sources of single cell 
protein. Mushrooms contain rich source of carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids an d 
dietary fibre. Vitamins such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, and the 
essential minerals selenium, copper and potassium are abundant in mushrooms. The 
foremost importance is that mushrooms do not have cholesterol, instead contain 
ergosterol that act as a precursor for vitamin D synthesis in human body. Mushrooms 
       
337 
 
are believed to help fight against cancer, relieves hypertension, imparts protection 
from heart diseases. Mushroom crop is in fact a boon that can solve several problems 
like the protein malnutrition, unemployment issues and environmental pollution. 
 
Mushrooms are cultivated indoors and do not require arable land and mushroom is a 
short duration crop with high yield per unit time. For small farmers and landless 
workers mushroom cultivati on is highly suitable for the economic and social security 
of this group. This hi -tech horticulture venture relieves the pressure on arable land, 
because it cultivation is indoors, and is also more suited to the women folk. 
Mushrooms supplement and complem ent the nutritional deficiencies and are 
regarded as the highest producers of protein per unit area and almost 100 times more 
than the conventional agriculture and animal husbandry. 
 
At present, in Tamil Nadu the annual production of mushroom is around 11, 000 
tonnes, button mushroom accounts for 7,500 tonnes, Oyster mushroom accounts for 
2700 tonnes and milky mushroom contributes for 800 tonnes. During the past two 
decades, the Mushroom Research and Training Centre of the Department of Plant 
Pathology, Tami l Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore has made tremendous 
efforts on transfer of mushroom cultivation technology by imparting trainings. By this 
way it has contributed for the establishment of about 50 spawn producers and 600 
oyster mushroom growers  accounting for 7 - 8 tonnes / day, 50 button mushroom 
growers producing 18 -20 tonnes / day and 35 milky mushroom growers contributing 
1-2 tonnes / day in Tamil Nadu. This account for around 8 per cent of total mushroom 
production of the country.

Mushroom Cultivation techniques for Oyster and Milk mushroom 
Base culture/ Nucleus culture 
 Tissue culture technique is used to bring the edible mushroom to pure culture so that 
the mushroom fungus can further be used to prepare spawn. Which is an essential 
material for mushroom cultivation. 
 This nucleus culture is grown on Potato Dextrose Agar medium in test tubes. 
 A small tissue from a well-grown mushroom is aseptically transferred to agar  
 medium in a test tube in a culture room. 
 The test tubes are incubated under room temperature for 10 days for full white  
 growth of fungal cultue. This is called base  culture/nucleus culture and further used  
 for preparation of Mother Spawn. 
 
Mother spawn 
Mother spawn is nothing but the mushroom fungus grown on a grain based medium. 
Among the several s ubstrate materials tested by TNAU, Coimbatore, sorghum grains are 
the best substrate for excellent growth of the fungus. Well -filled, disease -free sorghum 
grains are used as substrate for growing the spawn materials. The various steps involving 
in preparation of mother spawn are listed below here under. 
 The sorghum grains are washed in water thoroughly to remove chaffy and damaged  
 grains. 
 The grains are half cooked in an autoclave / vessel for 30 minutes to soften them. 
 The half cooked grains are spread evenly over hessian cloth on a platform to remove  
 the excess water. 
 Calcium carbonate is mixed thoroughly with the cooked, dried grains@ 20g/Kg. 
 The grains are filled inn polypropylene bags up to 3/4 th height (approximately 300 - 
 330 g/bag). 
 A one inch di ameter PVP ring is inserted on open end of the bag and plugged with  
 non-absorbent cotton wood. 
 The bags are arranged inside an autoclave and sterilized under 20-lbs,pressure for 2  
 hours. 
 The bags after cooling are kept inside the culture room under the UV light for 20 min. 
 After 20 minutes the UV light is put off and the fungal culture is transferred in to the  
 sterilized cholam bags. 
 The inoculated bags are kept in a clean room under temperature for 10 days for  
 further preparation of bed spawn. 
 
Bed Spawn 
The method of preparation of bed spawn was same as that of mother spawn. The 
cooking, filling and sterilization were similar to that of mother spawn. After sterilization, the 
bags are taken and the fully grown mother spawn is used for inoculation to  prepare bed 
spawn. Thirty bed spawn can be prepared from a single mother spawn. The bags are 
incubated at room temperature (27±2˚C) for 10 days and used as bed spawn.

Cultivation of Oyster mushroom 
The oyster mushrooms can be grown indoors in croppi ng house where a temperature of 
25-30o C and relative humidity of 80-85 per cent can be maintained. 
 Paddy straw is used as the raw substrate which has to be soaked in water for 4  
 hours and boiled or steamed in autoclave for 45 minutes and shade dried until 6 5- 
 70% moisture. 
 Cylindrical beds are prepared using 60x30 cm polythene bags with a thickness of 80  
 gauge.  
 Paddy straw and spawn are filled as alternate layers in polythene bags and 10 -12  
 holes are made in the beds. 
 The bags are placed in the cropping house/shed  in racks or in hanging rope system.  
 After 15-16 days when the paddy straws in the bags are covered with white mycelia  
 growth, pinheads start emerging where water spray is essential to prevent drying of  
 buds. 
 First harvest begins from 3-4 days after in head emergence and likewise at 5 -7 days  
 internal three harvests can be done. 
 Total cropping cycle is around 40-45 days. 
 The average bio efficiency ranges (100-150 per cent) depending on the variety. 
 
Cultivation of Milky mushroom 
 The milky mushroom requires a temperature of 30 -35˚C and relative humidity of 85 - 
 90 per cent. For cultivation of this mushroom two shed are needed. 
 Thatched shed / cropping house  (28±2˚C).for Spawn running  
 A sunken blue poly house (For Cropping) 
 Three feet deep pit is dug out and sides are lined with hollow blocks and semicircular  
 structure is built with GI pipe of Langley and covered with Blue silpaulin sheet. 
 Paddy straw is processed as in oyster mushroom cultivation and cylindrical beds are  
 prepared wit h 90x30 cm polythene bags and stored at 30 o C in thatched sheds  
 (spawn running room). 
 After 18-20 days when the paddy straws in the bags are covered with white mycelial  
 growth, the beds are cut in to two halves and casing soil (autoclaved garden soil) is  
 layered on to the cut halves for 2 cm height and sprayed with water. 
 The cased beds are placed in poly houses and the required tem premature is  
 maintained. 
 The pinheads emerge from the cut halves over the casing soil on 25-26th day. 
 First harvest be gins on 28 th day and likewise three - five harvests can be done. The  
 total cropping cycle is around 45 -50 days. The average bio efficiency ranges from  
 150-160 per cent.

29. WEED MANAGEMENT AND HERBICIDES USAGE IN HORTICULTURAL CROPS 
 
Weed management has become an integral part of Agriculture. There is little doubt that with 
the progressive modernisation of Indian Agriculture involving intensive inputs, herbicide 
use will steadily gain an importance in the coming years. In the recent decades, the growth 
of herbicides took place principally at the expense of fungicides, which declined from a 
market share of 40 per cent in 1960 to 25 per cent in 1995. About 72 per cent of the 
herbicide consumption out of the total took place in the developed countries, viz., USA, 
Western Europe and Japan. As against the growth of 2.5 per cent for insecticides and 3.3 
per cent for fungicides, the herbicides grew at the rate of 5.0 per cent per annum. 
 
In India, commercial use of herbicides came in 1980. During this period, the herbicides 
registered a significant growth than insecticides and fungicides. From a megre 2 per cent 
share of the total pesticide consumption in the seventies in India, herbicides now account 
for about 11 per cent of the pesticides market. While this is a very encouraging 
development, the herbicide consumption in our country is still much less than that in 
developed countries, where herbicides constitute 40 -50 per cent of the total pesticide 
consumption. 
 
Conjunctive use approach: 
There are several advantages of using soil applied herbicides in conjuction with 
fertilizers. Trials on impregnated of fertilizers with herbicides have been highly successful 
and fertilizers impregnated with several herbicides are now commercially available in 
USA.  Herbicides like Treflan, Sutan, Sencor and Bladox are being efficiently used through 
this technique. Adequate research efforts need to be undertaken in this regard to develop 
appropriate technology for the different agroclimatic conditions includingherbigation.[ 
 
System approach: 
Integrated weed management (IWM) practices for individual crops have been developed 
by several workers.  There is a need to study the various components of IWM into a 
system approach. 
 
Integrated weed management system  
This approach includes the use of high yielding varieties that resist weed competition and 
reduce the weed-seed reserve in the soil.  Practices like preplanting seed bed tillage, 
effective seed- bed preparation and seeding methods enhance crop growth and minimise 
weed growth. The use of crops that form early canopy with optimum plant population are 
integrated to optimize the crop growth and thus to minimise the weed growth. Precision in 
placement and timing of fertilizer application maximise stimulation of crops and minimise 
stimulation of weeds. The IWM system also includes the use of judicious irrigation 
practices, timely and appropriate cultivation, sound crop rotation, crop diversification, 
field sanitation and harvesting methods that do not spread weed seeds, use of 
biological agents and effective chemical methods.  However, the crop- weed 
interaction s are  comple x and needs applicatio n of recent advancement s for the 
development of future weed management strategies. 
 
 
       
358 
 
Crop-weed competition 
 
Experimental results have shown that crop-weed competition at critical stages of crop life 
has reduced the yields in several crops.  Often this period is approximately the first one 
fourth to one third of crop like for annual vegetables and for perennials flowering to 
maturity periods. Estimation of crop-weed interactions through mathematical models is 
being attempted. 
 
Modelling of crop-weed interactions 
 
Competition between crop and weed for growth inputs (light, water and nutrients) is a 
critical process in agricultural ecosystems.  The mechanisms of competition are not 
simple.  Models on weed invasion , populatio n growth and control will be useful for 
organizin g biological  informations on weeds and for developing weed control 
strategies.  Conventional field trials cannot answer several of the key questions in weed 
control because of the constraints of cost, time or complexity.  Hence models are 
essential as an integral part of weed management research and advice. 
 
Bio-herbicide 
approach 
Fungi are most useful and hence the term ‗mycoherbicide‘ is also used to refer bio-
herbicides.‗De vine‘ containing a formulation of soil borne fungus Phytophthora 
palmivora and Collegue containing spores of Colletrotrichu m gloeosporioide s an 
endemic anthrocnose fungus are commercialised bio-herbicides.  Other fungal bio-
herbicides have been developed including‗Velgo‘ based on Fusarium leteriteum and 
‗Casst‘, which is based on Alternaria cassiae. 
 
Naturally occurring 
herbicides 
 Many chemicals have been found to possess good herbicidal activity.  ‗Bialophos‘ is 
the first herbicide developed by this method and commercially marketed in Japan under the 
trade name‗Herbiace ‘ isolate d fro m fermentatio n broth s of Streptomyce s 
agroscopiu s and S. viridochromogens enhibits acidity against wide spectrum of 
grasses and broad leaved weeds on foliar application. 
 
FRUITS 
GRAPES  
Application of Diuron @ 3.5 kg/ha or Glyphosate @ 2 kg/ha. 
Herbicide application in grapevines must be done carefully with low pressure nozzle to 
prevent drift. 
 
BANAN
A 
Pre-emergence application of Atrazine or Diuron at 1.5 to 2 kg/ha soon after planting 
would keep the ground weed free for 3 to 5 months. At post emergence, Paraquat or 
Dalapon or 2,4 – D or Glyphosate can be used. 
 
PINEAPPLE 
 
Pre-emergence herbicides like Simazine or Atrazine or Diuron 3 to 4 kg/ha application 4 - 
6 weeks before planting and ploughing the field 2 weeks before the leaves of the crop 
       
359 
 
began to curled down to prevent weed establishment. Weed growth emerging later is 
treated with post emergence herbicides such as or Glyphosate 0.5 kg/ha or Dalopon 3 to 4 
kg/ ha or 2,4 - D 0.5 to 1 kg/ha depending upon the predominant weed species. Dalapan 
spray drift can cause chlorosis on outer leaves and necrosis on leaf tips when pineapple 
plants are young. It should be applied carefully any time from 6 months. 
 
VEGETABLES 
TOMATO 
In Tamil Nadu, tomatoes are being grown in three seasons namely June-July, December 
January and March. 
 
The critical period of weed competition in tomato is the first 30 days after transplanting. For 
the control of annual grasses, preplanting soil incorporation of Trifluralin 3 to 5 kg/ha or 
Nitralin 3 to 
5 kg/ha or Diphenamid 2 to 4 kg/ha is best.  Similar application of EPTC 2 to 3 kg/ha 
controls nutgrass.  Effective pre emergence herbicides of Pendi methalin 1.00 kg/ha, 
Alachlor 1 to 2 kg/ha, Metribuzin 0.75 kg/ha, Fluchloralin 1.0 kg/ha followed by one hand 
weeding on 30 DAS. Generall y, a pre emergence herbicide followed by one hand weeding 
in the later period of crop growth gives complete weed control. 
 
Herbicides which need preplant incorporation are particularly useful in the nursery.  In 
the transplanted field they are applied 3 to 4 weeks before planting seedlings.  
BRINJAL  
Pendimethalin @ 1.0 kg/ha  as pre sowing incorporated spray + one Hand weeding at 6 
weeks after transplanting or Pre emergence application of Oxyflourfen @ 0.5 kg/ha  at 3 
days after transplanting followed by one hand weeding at 30 days after transplanting. Post 
emergence application of Quizalofop -p-ethyl @ 1.00 kg/ha. 
 
ONION  
Onion germinates and grows relatively slow and hence weed competition is more critical 
upto 40 days after sowing. Pre plant incorporation of  Fluchloralin 1.0 kg/ha or Pre- 
emergence application of 0.20 kg/ha followed by one hand weeding at 45 days after sowing.

PLANTATION CROPS 
COFFEE 
Single tank mix application of Diuron 1 kg/ha with Paraquat 0.4 kg/ha or Glyphosate 0.8 
kg/ha. In coffee nurseries, apply Simazine 2 to 2.5 kg/ha immediately after planting coffee in 
polythene sleeves. 
At post emergence spray of 8 ml/ l of Paraquat or Glyphosate @15ml/ l are used to control 
many perennial weeds. 
Sequential application of Dalapan 1 to 2 weeks later by Paraquat and subsequently by 
Dalapan controls perennial grasses effectively. 
 
TEA 
Although herbicides are now used over 60% of the area under tea, manual methods 
like cheeling, sickling and mulching are extensively used wherever labour is available 
than by chemical method. Cheeling removes the above ground weed growth and 
prepares the ground for pre-emergence herbicide application. Sickling is done to remove 
the tall growth of perennial weeds  and cut it back to the ground level for a follow up 
application of foliage applied herbicides on the regrowth. 
Pre-emergance application of Oxyfluorfen @ 0.40 kg/ha. Foliag e application of Paraquat 
(8ml/l) + 2,4 – D(6g/l) or Glyphosate(15ml/l) depending on the weed spectrum and this 
would keep tea weed-free for the rest PE application of Oxyfluorfen at 0.40 kg/ha of  the 
year. 
 
Nursery: 
Weed control in clonal nursery is done by (2 to 3 weeks before planting cuttings) 
application of Simazine at 2 kg/ha. After 6 months Simazine is applied once again at the 
same dose. 
In the case of seed nurseries hand removal is done for 6 months after planting and then 
Simazine applied at 2 kg/ha. 
 
Young tea (Until 3 years) 
Application of Simazine 1.5 to 2 kg/ha or Paraquat 0.3 – 0.4 kg/ha at pre-emergence and 2,4 
– D 0.5 to 1 kg/ha at post emergence. 
 
Matured tea (Above 3 years) 
 
Simazine 1.5 to 2 kg/ha or Diuron 2 kg/ha as pre-emergence herbicides. Paraquat or 2,4 
– D or Paraquat + MSMA or Glyphosate are applied as post emergence.

Mechanical thresher for pepper (Piper nigrum L.) 
 
Pepper (Piper nigrum L.), the king of spices is the most important spice of India. It is the dried 
fruit of perennial climbing vine, mostly found in hot and moist parts of Southern India. Kerala 
alone contributes 96% of the total production in India. 
 
The spikes of well-matured, unripe berries are manually picked when they are blackish green 
and most pungent by climbing on the ladders. Normally two women jointly do the harvesting. 
Threshing of pepper berries is done by manual trampling, which involves either a man / woman 
labour. A labourer will be able to trample about 200 kg of spikes and separate the berries. The 
empty spikes are disposed to the compost pit and used as manure. To overcome the drudgery 
to the labourer, a mechanical  thresher has been developed at the Department of Agricultural 
Processing, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore. 
 
This pepper thresher consisted of a metallic drum provided with rasp bars, concave, oscillating 
sieve, power source and power drive.  On the periphery of the drum, 8 numbers of rasp bars 
made of wood are mounted. The drum is placed inside a concave provided with an opening and a  
suitable cover. A feed hopper is provided for easy feeding of spikes into the concave. An 
oscillating sieve is provided with an eccentric to separate the berries and spikes after threshing. 
The power to the drum is transmitted through V pulley arrangement from a 2 hp motor.

Fluidised Bed Dryer for Mushroom 
Mushroom, contains about 90% moisture and is highly perishable. To reduce the spoilage and 
increase the shelf life of the mushroom, drying is one of the techniques. By the traditional sun 
drying method it takes about 10 to 14 hours to dry the mushroom to a final moisture content of 
about 8 per cent. By mechanical drying, mushroom is dried at higher temperature and faster 
which preserves the colour and the quality of the final product. Hence, a mechanical dryer 
suitable for drying of oyster and milky mushroom by the medium and large growers has been 
developed in the Department of Agricultural Processing, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, 
Coimbatore. 
The developed dryer is of fluidised bed type, as this type of drying is faster and uniform 
compared to that cabinet drying and tray drying. The fluidised bed dryer consists of a centrifugal 
blower, holding bin, heating coils, motor and thermostat control. The blower is run by a 3 hp, 
three phase motor. The delivery of the blower is connected to the heater drum, provided four 
numbers of fin type electrical heaters of each 500 Watts and controlled  through a stem type 
thermostat. At the other end of the heater drum, the drying chamber is placed. Hot air of 50 to 
90°C temperature at a flow rate of 9 to 32 m3/ minute can be obtained in this dryer. The whole 
assembly is placed on a suitable frame made of mild steel. 
The atmospheric air discharged by the blower reach the heater drum and come in contact with 
the heaters and heated. The hot air entering into the drying chamber dries the mushroom. The 
velocity of air is controlled by adjusting the position of the shutter in the suction of the blower, so 
that the mushroom pieces float over the bin surface during drying. It takes about 2 and 6 hours 
to dry the oyster and milky mushroom to a final moisture of 8-10 %(w.b) from an initial moisture 
content of 70-80%(w.b).

Pulper cum washer for coffee 
Coffee is an important commercial and high altitude crop grown in southern and north- eastern 
parts of our country. Its annual production is 2.1 lakh tonnes. Pulping and washing are the 
important unit operations in the coffee processing. The coffee pulper and washers available at 
present are of higher capacities and the cost is beyond the reach of small farmers.  To meet the 
requirement of small and marginal farmers an integrated unit with  pulping and washing 
mechanism has been developed by Department of Agricultural Processing, Tamil Nadu Agricultural 
University, Coimbatore - 3. 
The unit essentially consists of a trapezoidal hopper, drum type pulper and a screw auger 
model washer.  The hopper holds and feeds the coffee fruits to the pulper uniformly through a 
fluted roller mechanism. The pulper has a drum with projections and two breastplates. Provisions 
are made to adjust the clearance between the breastplate and drum so as to pulp different sizes 
of fruits. The pulper removes the skin from the matured ripened fruits. The skin is discharged 
over the perforated inclined tray fitted below the pulper and collected separately. 
 
The washer has an inner roller and a perforated outer cylinder.  The inner roller is made of mild 
steel pipe with screw auger and helical bars with cross stoppers for conveying the parchment. The 
inner roller is mounted on bearings inside the perforated outer cylinder. During operation, the 
parchment is moved in between the perforated outer cylinder and inner roller. Friction and 
abrasion developed due to movement of beans remove the mucilage present over the parchment. 
By adjusting the counter weight provided at the discharge end, the pressure inside the washer 
is regulated and thorough washing of the bean is achieved. 
 
Water for washing is provided on the top of the perforated outer cylinder through five nipples 
placed at equal intervals and is regulated by a valve.  Both pulper and washer are operated by a 
3-hp electric motor through suitable pulleys and belt. 
Salient features: 
! Capacity of the unit is 500 kg of fruits per hour 
! Water requirement is only 4 litres of water per kg of fruits. 
! The approximate cost of the unit is Rs.50,000/-. 
Mechanical Chipper for Tapioca 
Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) is a root crop cultivated for use of food, animal feed and production 
of starch. In India tapioca is grown in 0.35 million ha. area and produces about 6 million tonnes 
annually.  The physiological deterioration of tapioca root is related to accumulation after the 
harvest within a shorter period of one week.  This spoilage can be prevented by chipping and 
drying of tapioca tubers. At present the tuber is sliced manually which is highly time consuming 
and in-efficient, besides causing drudgery to the personworking. Therefore a vertical feed type 
motorised tapioca chipping machine has been developed in the Department of Agricultural 
Processing, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore. 
The developed tapioca chipper consists mainly of a feed hopper with guides, chipping disc with 
knives, chips outlet and a 0.5 HP single phase electric motor. The feed hopper is provided with 
vertical guides made of pipes of diameter 25 to 80 mm for 100 mm length to facilitate feedings of 
tubers of varying diameters. Through these guides the tubers reach the chipping disc having 
three blades, rotating at 300 rpm.  The radially mounted blades on the chipping disc slice the 
tuber and the chip is collected through the outlet. 
Salient features:

! Suitable for varying diameters of tubers 
! Thickness of chips can be varied 
! Also suitable for slicing other tuber crops like radish, carrot, potato °etc. 
! The capacity of the unit is 270 kg per hour. 
! The cost of the unit is Rs.10,000/-. 
Tomato Seed Extractor 
Tomato is one of the important commercial crop ranking second in importance to potato in 
India. At present, seed extraction from tomato is carried out manually by squeezing the fruits 
and by scooping the seeds, with hands.  Manual method is unhygienic, tedious, highly labour 
intensive and time-consuming process. In certain places, mechanical seed extraction is practiced 
using a juicer or pulper.  The juice is filtered out while the pulp and seeds are separated by acid, 
alkali, or fermentation methods. The pulp is discarded since the whole fruit is pulped and the 
seed is separated by filtration with repeated washing. In order to make use of the flesh in the 
tomato for further processing, the extraction of the seed has to be done by crushing the fruits in a 
hygienic way. Considering all these facts, a tomato seed extractor has been developed by 
Department of Agricultural Processing, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore- 3. The 
newly fabricated tomato seed extractor consists of a feed hopper, fruit crushing chamber, seed 
separation unit, water recycling system and seed collecting trough. The fruit crushing chamber 
consists of a rotating shaft with a screw auger of 90 mm diameter and 45 mm pitch. In the 
crushing chamber the tomato fruits are crushed and squeezed by the rotating screw auger. As 
the squeezed fruit crosses the squeezing zone seed separation starts. The seed separation 
unit consists of a rotating shaft with studs (arranged in a helical fashion throughout its length), a 
perforated outer cover, water distribution nozzles, rectangular trough, seed outlet and squeezed 
fruit outlet. 
 
As the squeezed fruit enters the seed separation unit, the studs open the squeezed fruit, 
exposing the seeds to the stream of water.  The water separates the seed from the flesh and 
comes down along with the seed through the perforated outer cover and is collected in a 
rectangular trough, placed at the bottom of seed separation unit. The water collected in the 
trough is recycled by means of a centrifugal pump. The flesh coming out of the seed separation 
unit is collected separately. The power for the crushing the fruits and water recycling is taken 
from the 0.5-hp electric motor fitted at the bottom of the unit. 
Salient features: 
! Capacity of the unit is 180 kg of fruit (1.8 kg of seed) per hour. 
! The cost of unit is Rs.25,000/-. 
! Cost of seed extraction per kg is Rs.10/-. 
! The saving in cost is 90 per cent 
! Saving in time is 97 per cent. 
Brinjal seed extractor 
Brinjal, a non-seasonal important vegetable crop is grown all over India throughout the year, in 
an area of 0.45 million ha had recorded about 5.8 million tonnes of production. Seed is one of the 
important inputs and plays a key role in the productivity and production of any crop and 
brinjal too. At present, seeds are extracted from brinjal fruits, manually by beating the fruits with 
mallet, trampling under feet, squeezing with hands, splitting the fruits and scooping seeds, etc. 
The manual methods of extraction of seed are tedious, highly time and labour consuming process. 
Sometimes delayed seed extraction resulted in decreased seed quality and increased cost. 
       
378 
 
Keeping this in view, a new gadget for the extraction of seeds from brinjal has been developed. 
The brinjal seed extractor consists of a fruit crushing chamber and seed separation unit. In the 
fruit crushing chamber, 70 mm length crushing rods are fixed in the shaft which crushes the fruit 
into pulp with the help of feed water and discharges the same into the bottom portion of the seed 
separation unit. The seed separation unit houses a horizontal sieve bottom, sloping solid bottom 
below the sieve bottom, seed outlet, agitato r, pulp outlet and drain cock.  The inclined bottom  
of the seed separation unit helps for easy collection of seeds towards the seed outlet. Seeds 
are collected along with water by opening the value and keeping a sieve tray with 3 mm holes. 
The brushes fixed in the agitator move over the sieve surface, remove the lodged seeds if any 
and keep the sieve always clean for easy passage of seeds through the sieve. 
 
The brinjal fruit pulp with seeds is introduced into the seed separation unit at the bottom in a 
standing column of water.  The rotating agitator with radial arms, agitates and separates the 
denser healthy seeds from pulp and ill filled light seeds. Due to the difference in specific weight, 
the good seeds are moving towards the bottom, pass through the sieve and get collected through 
seed outlet. The lighter pulp and other ill filled seeds rise to the surface and discharged through 
the pulp outlet. 
 
Salient features: 
! Capacity of the unit is 120 kg of fruits or 2 kg of seeds per hour. 
! The cost of the unit is Rs.25,000/-. 
! The cost of seed extraction is Rs.10/- per kg of seed. 
! Savings in cost is 88.9%. 
! Savings in time is 97.5%.

Dehusker for fresh arecanut 
              Arecanut is being cultivated in 3.86 lakhs ha in India with a 
production of 4.76 lakhs tones of kernels. Most of the areca produced in 
Tamil Nadu is dehusked in green state. Labour requirement for 
dehusking is estimated as 7 -8 kg of nuts per hour per labour.  This 
involves huge labour requirement and high cost. Existing models are 
expensive and also cause damage to the kernels.  The machine has 
longitudinal profiled blades. The concave had two spring loaded rubber 
pads that press the fruit gently against the rotor. The fruits are fed at the 
top manually. The fruits travel half the circumference and are dehusked 
in the process. The dehusked kernals fall to the bottom along with the 
husk.  Tests were conducted with   both the models. The speed was varied from 40 to 80 rpm. 
The results showed that the dehusking efficiency was 53 to 67%. The best dehusking 
performance was observed in 60 rpm. The breakage was observed in the range of 8 to 10 %.

CONTINUOUS AONLA DE-SEEDING MACHINE  
Aonla is an indigenous tropical fruit and is a rich source of vitamin C  
(400-1300 mg/ 100 g). It is being used in the Ayurvedic  medicines and now a days it is also 
used in the preparation of value added products like jam, jellies, pickles, preserves (Murabba) 
and Ready to Serve beverages.Removal of seed from aonla is a pre-requisite for the processing 
of aonla fruit into different  value added products. At present the seed is being removed with the 
hand operated equipment of capacity 10 kg/h which is a cumbersome process and also time 
consuming.  
In order to eliminate the drudgery in the removal of seed and to increase the capacit y, a 
continuous aonla de-seeding machine has been developed at Post Harvest Technology Centre, 
TNAU, Coimbatore. 
  The unit essentially consists 
of a feed hopper, singulating unit, 
metering mechanism and seed 
removal unit. The aonla fruits dropping 
through the feed hopper are 
singulated by means of guide plates 
and endless flat belt. The metering 
mechanism keeps the fruits on the 
fruit seater of the base plate smoothly. 
The seed from aonla is removed by piercing rod which is actuated with cam and gear 
mechanism. The unit is powered by a 2 HP electric motor. 
Special  features of the equipment: 
BIOCOLOUR FROM BEETROOT 
              Biocolour from beetroot was prepared by utilizing as natural colour in processed foods by 
replacing the synthetic colours. The beetroot was washed in water and the outer skin and stalks 
were removed . The peeled beetroot was cut into small pieces and pulped by adding aqueous 
solution containing 3.0 per cent acetone (4 part beetroot pulp: 1 part aqueous solution). The 
beetroot pulp was filtered and the extracted juice TSS was adjusted to 25 ° brix by a dding 
maltodextrin. Citric acid (0.1%), calcium sterate (0.1%) and gallnut powder (2%) was added to the

juice and mixed thoroughly and filtered. The filtered juice was spray dried at a temperature of 200 °c. 
The stability of the biocolour from beetroot powder was studied at different levels of pH, preservative 
and temperature respectively. The physio - chemical characteristics of the freshly prepared 
biocolour from beetroot powder contained sedimentation - nil, solubility -100 per cent, acetone 
residues - nil, colour values 88.66, 4.57 and - 2.13   L* a* b*, moisture - 2.07 per cent, pH - 4.2, 
carbohydrate - 69.36  per cent, protein - 5.50 per cent, fat - 0.2 per cent, fiber - 0.28 per cent, ash - 
4.8 per cent, total antioxidant - 16.36 mg /g and tannin - 2.74 per cent.. The prepared biocolour was 
applied in processed foods viz., beverages (milk shake), jam, jelly, candies (jujups and lollipop), 
sweetmeats (halwa and kesari), icings and icecream and the level of incorporation of biocolour was 
optimized. Incorporation of biocolour in processed foods was ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 per cent and 
the synthetic colour was between 0.01 and 0.03 per cent. Organoleptic evaluation studies showed 
that the overall acceptability the processed products ranged from 8.0 to 8.6 in itially and from 7.5 to 
8.0 at the end of 180 days. For 100 kg of fresh beetroot yielded 19.0 kg of biocolour. The cost of the   
biocolour from beetroot powder was Rs. 56/. per 100 gram.

33. Soil Test Crop based Integrated Plant Nutrition System for Horticultural Crops  
(STCR-IPNS)    
 Soil test crop response based fertilizer prescriptions under integrated plant nutrition 
system (STCR -IPNS) for horticultural crops  provide a scientific basis  wherein the fertiliser 
doses for NPK are tailored to the requirement of NPK for specific yield levels of crops taking into 
account the contribution of NPK from soil, fertilizer and organic  and or  biofertilisers. Being a site 
and situation specific technology, STCR-IPNS along with entire improved package of practices for 
various crops ensures balanced nutrition, increased productivity and efficiency of applied NPK with 
sustained soil health over long run. The STCR- IPNS recommendations for various horticultural 
crops are furnished in Tables 1-17 and can be adopted to similar and allied soil types.

About Government Botanical Gardens, Udhagamandalam 
 
The Government Botanical Gardens, nestled in a beautiful ravine with its entire splendor lying 
adjacent to the Raj Bhavan within the town. It covers an area of 22 ha ascending the slope on the 
hill at an elevation of 2400 - 2500 metres above MSL. 
 
The gardens enjoys a cool temperate climate with an average rainfall of 140 cm per annum, 
most of which is received during South-West monsoon with frostly nights from November to 
February. The maximum and minimum temperatures are 290   C to 00   C respectively. 
 
Before the garden was laid out, the area was then a patch of vegetable Garden.  The upper 
portion with a wildness of Shola and shrubs, the lower part a swamp traversed by deep ravines. 
Early in 1847 at the aspiration of Marquis of Tweedale who was then the Governor of Madras, a 
fund was raised by donations and subscriptions to start a public garden. 
 
In 1848, Mr. C. Mc Iver who had the training at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, London was 
appointed as Superintendent of the Government Botanic Gardens, Udhagamandalam. 
 
The main garden is divided into six different sections, viz., 
 
! The front gardens 
 
! The band stand 
 
! The conservatory and its surroundings 
 
! The fountain terrace and picnic gardens 
 
! The new band stand and its surroundings 
 
! And the nurseries 
 
The Government Botanic Gardens, Udhagamandalam had played an important role in the earlier 
years by introducing many crops in the Nilgiris.  Systematic introduction and maintenance of 
plants has resulted in the collection of about 2000 spices of plants representing 119 natural 
orders. 
The Government Botanic Gardens, Udhagamandalam is from the inception, the primary centre of 
Horticulture development in the Nilgiris. 
In the recent past, studies on various aspects of ornamental plants such as propagation 
techniques, cultivation methods, etc., are undertaken apart from introduction of new species of 
plants enriching the existing collection.

The special feature of the Government Botanic Gardens, Udhagamandalam is the conduct of 
flower show in the middle of May, every year.  Exhibitions and competitive shows on various 
collection s of  flowers are held during the show.   The show draws an immense crowd of 
enthusiasts and tourists every year. 
 
 
Growth and development of moringa under organic and inorganic systems of culture 
 
An experiment was conducted to find out the efficacy of organic manures viz., FYM, poultry 
manure, neem cake, biofertilizer viz., azospirillum, VAM and natural organic product panchakavya on 
the growth and yield of moringa. The treatment combinations of poultry manure + neem cake 
+ panchakavya (2% spray) out yielded other treatments for the growth and yield characters. 
Days to 50% flowering was advanced to 14.93 days in the above treatment. The yield attributes 
viz., number of pods / tree (225.57), pod weight (95.37g), pod yield 35.67 kg / tree were highest in 
the above treatment combination of poultry manure + neem cake + panchakavya. The nutrient 
contents viz., carotene (144.97 mg / 100g ascorbic acid (131.53mg / 100g) and soluble protein 
(5.74 g/100g) were found to be highest in the same treatment combination of poultry manure + 
neem cake + panchakavya. It was also found that the treatment combination of poultry manure + 
neem cake + panchakavya was very effective in controlling the fruit fly incidence (26.4%), when 
compared to control (38.22%). 
 
 
Studies on the manipulation of source – sink relationship for increasing the fruit size of 
tomato hybrid H24 x CLN 2123 A 
In tomato,  the hybrid H2s x CLN 2123 A showed greater response for the application of 
panchakavya.  It was found that the treatment combinations of panchakavya 5% at nursery 
state and 40 days after transplanting + tender coconut spraying (10% once in a  week for 3 
times) (T8)   recorded highest number of fruits per plant of 71.40, followed by 71.0 in the 
panchakavya 5% spray at nursery stage alone (T4) whereas the control registered the lowest 
number of fruits of 43.25.  Similarly, the fruit weight and yield per plant were also highest in the 
treatment T8 (59.4g and 3.65 kg respectively). Fruit quality parameters viz., TSS , Total acidity and 
ascorbic acid contents were also highest in the treatment T8 (7.5, 0.73% and 16.8 mg/100g 
respectively).  
 
Organic production package for Coleus forskohlii 
 
In a study conducted with Coleus forskohlii revealed that application of panchakavya 4% 
spray was found to be superior in respect of root yield 12.40 kg / plot. when  compared to 
control 5.23 kg / plot. Similarly, number of roots same  (14.99), root length (13.73 cm), root 
diameter (2.49 cm) and root weight (459.35 g/ plant) was maximum in the above treatment when 
compared to control.

Standardization of organic production package for Withania somnifera 
 
An experiment was conducted for the standardization of organic production package of 
Withania somnifera at Horticultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural 
University, Coimbatore. Panchakavya 2%, 3% and 4% sprays and moringa leaf extracts 10 ml 
/plant, 20 ml / plant and 30 ml/ plant and chemicals cytozyme 1%, A tonic -1% and Miraculan – 
1% sprays were given. Panchakavya 4% was found to be the best among all the treatments for 
growth and yield characters viz., plant height (145.63 cm), shoot fresh weight (976.24g), number of 
fruits (498.46) fruit yield (64.74 g / plant) and root length (54.21cm) . Compared to control, with only 
98.48 cm, 720.61 g, 348.67, 36.23g /plant, 38.62 cm respectively. 
 
 
Effect of organics on growth and yield of Bhendi cv. Varsha Uphar 
 
An experiment was  conducted to study the effect of panchakavya and moringa leaf extract on 
growth and yield of bhendi var. Varsha Uphar at Department of Vegetable Crops, Horticultural 
College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore.  Four sprays 
panchakavya (3%) and moringa leaf extract (25 ml/plant) were used started from 2 weeks after 
sowing and then the subsequen t sprays given  at 15 days interval .   Both the treatment s 
viz., panchakavya and moringa leaf extract were revealed the higher plant height, number of 
branches per plant, number of fruits per plant and fruit yield than the control (water spray). 
Moringa leaf extract  increased the  higher plant height and numbers of branches, while the 
number of fruits and fruit yield were the highest in panchakavya treated plants. 
 
Physiology of petal shedding in Rose 
 
A study was conducted on the physiology of petal shedding in two cultivars of rose, viz., 
Edward rose and Red rose. It was found that the treatment calcium acetate 0.5% + panchakavya 
5% significantly influenced the morphological characters, such as the height of the bush, length of 
the flowering shoot and the floral characters, such as  the flower  diameter, pedicel length, 
receptacle diameter, number of petals and petal : receptacle ratio. The treatment panchakavya 
5% resulted in earlier flowering of 45.6 days and 53.31 days in cv. Edward rose and cv. Red 
rose respectively. 
 
Studies on the effect of pinching, spacing and growth regulators on growth, yield and 
quality of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera ) 
 
In Ashwagandha, the yield attributes viz., root length (50.67 cm), root girth (4.93cm), root primaries 
(6.50 cm), root fresh (96.33g), dry weight (38.27 g) and root bark weight (22.33g) per plant were the 
highest under the treatment pinching + wider spacing + panchakavya (3% spray). 
 
However the treatment pinching + closer spacing (60 x 30cm) + panchakavya (3%) registered the 
highest root yield of 1350 kg / hectare. 
 
Biodynamic Agriculture  
 
 ―Biodynamic Farming‖ refers to working with energies, which create and maintain life(Pfeffer, 1984). 
The term derives from Greek Word ―Bios (life) and ‗dynamics‘ (energy). The use of word ―method‖ 
indicates that one is not dealing merely with the production of another fertilizer, organic though it 
is, but rather that certain principles are involved which in the practical application secure a healthy 
       
415 
 
soil and plants which in turn produce  healthfuy food for man and healthy  feed for animals .  
Biodynamic agriculture works on the following principles: 
 
! To restore to the soil, the organic matter in the form of humus, which holds it‘s fertility. 
 
! To establish, maintain and improve  soil living system. 
 
! Organic matter as the basic factor for the soil life. 
 
! Biodynamic method is not only fertilizing the soil but skillfull application of the factors 
contributing to soil life and health. Establish a system that brings into balance all factors 
which maintain life. 
 
! In biodynamic way of treating manure and composts, the knowledge of enzymatic, hormone and 
other factors are also included. 
 
! The biodynamic method puts special emphasis on the importance of crop rotation, green 
manuring and cover crops. 
 
! The soil is not only a chemical, mineral or organic system, but it also has a physical 
structure.  Maintenance of a crumbly, friable, deep, well-aerated  structure is essential 
feature of fertile soil. 
 
 
Efforts are being made to elaborate the concept and brief account of preparations used in 
biodynamic agriculture with a few explanations and experiences with the cultivation practices. 
 
 
The cosmic factor that determines a month is the Moon.  The movement of the Moon in 
relation to the Zodiac is more interesting.  These Zodiac symbols are Greek in origin.  The 
system has 12 constellations though represented by different archetype figures and animals. 
Within these 12 signs, there are four groups of these constellations, each of which have same 
qualities.  They are related to basic four elements, i.e. earth, water, fire and air.  These four 
elements can be placed in relation to influencing the four parts of the plant, the root, leaf, flower, and 
fruit as summarized below. 
 
! Root is associated with the earth. There is no root growth without earth, 
 
! Leaf is associated with water because it contains more than 80 per cent water, 
 
! Flower corresponds to air and light.  There is no light without air (no light on the  
    Moon) because there is no atmosphere, 
! Fruit and seed associated with fire, there is no fruit seed maturity without warmth. Performing 
farm operations on specific days means harnessing these cosmic influences for development of 
a particular plant part. 
 
The earth is emerged in the planetary spheres of solar system and these forces stamp themselves for 
example, morphology of the plants.  The earthly forces of Moon, Mercury and Venus soak into 
the earth form the air above and the cosmic forces of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn moves upward 
from the rocks below. They interact in the region of clay so that the plants grow out of it. The light of 
the Sun, Moon, Planets and stars reaches to the plants in regular rhythms.   
Each contributes  to the life, growth and form of the plant.  Planets impress effect on 
metals, rocks, plants,  animals and man, so called ―astral influences‖ coined from Greek where 
astar means, ―star‖. Just as sunshine contributes to the growth of plants and moon affect water 
       
416 
 
content of all organisms, the planet also influences the earth and all who dowell on her. Since olden 
time, they have been divided as inner planet (Moon, Mercury and Venus between earth and Sun) and 
outer planets (Mars, Jupiter and Saturn).  The inner planets work directly through  atmosphere 
are indirectly via water, humus or calcium (limestone, potassium and sodium) on growth of plants. 
 
The influences of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are channeled through warmth and silica (quartz, 
feldspar and mica), they stream in through silica contents of soil and on plants being expressed in 
colours of flower and in fruit and seed production. By understanding the gesture and effect of each 
rhythm, agricultural activities like soil preparation, sowing, intercultural operations and harvesting 
need to be programmed accordingly. 
 
Biodynamic Calendar 
 
Biodynamic farmers use the knowledge practically by choosing time to show on plant, to use 
various plant husbandry techniques. Agricultural practices, i.e. field preparation, sowing, manuring, 
harvestin g etc.  performe d as per constellatio n are more effectiv e and beneficial . Every 
constellation has dominant elemental influence and affects four specific parts of the plants as 
enumerated below in Table 1. 
 
Interaction of element and constellation on plant parts 
 
Element Plant part Constellation 
Earth Root Virgo, Capricorn, Taurus 
Air Flower Germini, Libra, Aquarius 
Water Leaf Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces 
Fire Fruit Aries, Leo, sagittarius 
 
Agricultural practices for better root activity (manuring and rooting), flowering, growth and 
fruiting/seed is to be done as per constellation. 
 
Ascending period of moon: During this period, cosmic forces are active above the earth / ground. Any 
agricultural practice (spray, propagation etc.) performed during the period show beneficial effect. 
Descending period of moon : During this period, cosmic forces are active below the earth. 
Therefore, agricultural practices (field preparation, sowing, manuring and harvesting of root crops) 
performed during the period shows better success. 
 
Agricultural Operation as per Movement of Moon : The moon moves regularly around earth and it 
travels monthly through each of the 12 signs of the Zodiac, staying approximately two-and-a half 
days in each sign. As it does so, it forms an angular relationship with the sun that is known as a 
Phase of the Moon, which means the angle between moon, earth and sun. Moon orbits the earth 
and the earth orbits the sun.  It is the earths orbit that defines the ‗ecliptic‘, which is divided 
symbolically into the zodiac.

Phases occur in two stages – waxing and waning 
The moon is ―waxing‖ (ascending period) – growing during these phases stages 
are : New moon, crescent moon, fist quarter moon, gibbous moon. 
The moon is waning (descending period) – shrinking – during these phases 
Full moon disseminating second quarter balsamic. 
 
As a general thumb rule, when moon is waxing plants develop leaves above the 
ground systems and when moon is waning, plants develop their root system. 
 
Planting leafy crops that grow above ground are best sown at waxing moon and those 
that will  require strong root system or grow below ground should be snow after full 
moon, in the waning phase. 
 
Perigee (Poornima : full moon) when the moon is nearest to the earth, this occurs after 
every 
29 and half day. In 48 hours, proceeding to full moon, there appears to be distinct increase in 
the moisture content of the earth and in the atmosphere. Growth promoting activities of the 
plants seems to be enhanced and plants are more susceptible to fungal attack because of 
relatively higher moisture content in the rhizosphere and atmosphere. 
 
Apogee (new moon) – when the moon is farthest from the earth. This occurs every 27th 
and ½ days.  Owing to moisture deficiency, harvesting and seed storage practices 
show better response. 
 
Moon opposite to Saturn – this is favourable period, agricultural operation performed 
during this period show better response. 
 
Lunar Node 
 
Imaginary point when moon crosses path of sun. It occurs twice in 27.2 days of a month 
and known as Rahu and Ketu 
 
Rahu  - Lunar node in ascending period of moon not suitable for agricultural 
activities. Ketu -  Lunar node in descending period, not suitable for 
agricultural activities.

Biodynamic 
preparations 
 
Basically there are two types of biodynamic 
preparations. 
 
! Biodynamic field sprays (BD-500-501). 
! Biodynamic compost preparations (BD-502-
507). Biodynamic Field Sprays (BD 500-501) 
Cow horn manure (BD-500) : This is fundamental biodynamic field spray preparation. The 
cow is an earthy creature with a very strong digestive system.  The cow horn has  the 
ability to absorb life  energies during decomposition of the dung being incubated in winter 
months. 
 
Steps in 
preparation 
 
! Cow horns are cleaned properly  with  water.  While  collecting the horn it should 
be ascertained that only cow horn to the picked which is solid from proximal end their 
rings are at distal end. 
 
! Cleaned cow horns are filled with fresh cowdung (especially from lactating and 
indigenous one) and buried at 30 cm depth in the soil in root free zone in descending 
period of moon during October – November. 
 
! After 6 months of incubation, horns are taken out in descending period from moon  
      during March- April.  
! If decomposition of dung is not proper, cow horns should not be taken out and should 
be left for some more period and again is to be taken out during descending period of 
moon. 
 
! Properly decomposed compost is to be stored at cool and dry place in earthen pot. 
 
Specially prepared manure is made into a spray to vitalize the soil, enhance seed 
germination, root formation and primary root development. For spraying, 25g of BD-500 is 
dissolved in 13.5 litres of water in wooden / plastic bucket by making vortext in clock and 
anti-clockwise for one hour in the evening and the solution is spread either with the help of 
natural brush or with a tree twig.  Spraying of BD-500 is done at the time of field 
preparation in descending period of the moon. Stirring small quantities of material in large 
amount of water is called Dynamization. This process transfers the forces and energy from 
the preparation to the water. 
 
Thimmaiah (2001) observed the microbial activity of BD-500 during stirring and very 
interesting response has been obtained.

It is interesting to observe that during stirring period, there was a corresponding increase 
in number of cfu‘s of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi during one hour of stirring.  The 
CISH, Luckno w, has also identified the following microorganisms (fungi) from BD-500 
preparation. 
 
* Fusarium semitatum 
* F. sporotrichiodes 
* Syncephalastrum racemosum 
 
Cow horn silica (BD-501) : In this, ground mountain quartz (silica) after proper 
incubation is made in to spray on plants.  It helps them to achieve optimum development 
and maturity and particularly affects taste, colour and aroma. 
 
Steps in 
preparation 
 
! After taking out of cow horn manure (BD-500), cow horns are thoroughly cleaned 
with water.  
! Cow horns are filled with silica with powder paste, and buried in same pit where cow 
horns were buried for the preparation of BD-500 during ascending period of moon in 
March-April.  
! After 6 months of incubation , horns are taken out in October-November during 
the ascending period of moon.  
! Light yellowish silica powder is taken out from the horn and stored in light near the 
house window in glass jars. 
 
BD 501 works on photosynthetic process in the leaf. Its action is to strengthen the effect of 
light and warmth on the plant and promotes healthy growth. It strengthens the quality of plant 
and the plant product and encourages the development of fruit and seeds. For maximum 
effect, the BD 
501 should be applied once at the beginning of a plant‘s life, at the four-leaf stage and again 
at the flowering or fruit maturation stage.  BD 501 should be applied on the leaves in the 
form of ‗mist‘ in the morning at the sunrise and the best constellation is moon in opposite to 
Saturn. Following fungi are isolated from BD -501 at this Insitute. 
* Fusarium monliformae 
* Penicilium chrysogenum

* Syncephalastrum racemosum 
Biodynamic Field 
Sprays 
 
Biodynamic sets  (BD-502-507) are prepared from six herbal plants, which have 
healing properties  and influence the fermentation processes in the compost, liquid  
manure and Cow Pat  Pit.  These are also associated with particular constellations as 
summarized in Table.4. All these preparations are made in descending period of the moon, 
except BD-507, which is best prepared  in air / light day. The BD sets are used in the 
Cow Pat Pit (CPP), BD – compost, Biodynamic  liquid manure and Biodynamic liquid 
pesticides.

Cowdung and urine are important components of Cow Pat Pit (CPP), BD liquid manure and 
BD pesticides. Their brief account are summarized below. 
 
Cow Pat Pit (CPP) or Barrel Manure 
 
It is a biodynamic field  preparation also called as soil shampoo.  Cow Pat Pit (CPP) 
is a strong soil conditioner. It enhances seed germination, promotes rooting in cutting and 
grafting, improvement in soil texture, provides resistance powers to the plants against pests 
and diseases, replenishes and rectifies the trace element deficiency. CPP is increasingly 
       
421 
 
used for improving soil biological activities in the seed treatment and foliar applications. The 
CPP may be prepared throughout the year. 
 
Steps in 
preparation  
! Preparation of a pit of 60cm x 90cm size in shade and root-free zone. Precaution is to 
be taken that pit should be 15cm higher than plane surface.  
! Pasting of inner wall of the pit with fresh cowdung paste.  
! Dung of lactating cow (60kg) mixed thoroughly with 250g each of bentonite and egg 
shell powder and filled in the pit.  
! Compost gets ready in 75-90 days depending upon the temperature. 
  
One kg CPP dissolved in 40-45 litres of water overnight and sprinkled in the next morning 
as field sprays on the plants. This should be applied at the time of field preparation and on 
plants. CPP can also be applied in BD compost and with FYM for improving their nutritive 
value. The preparation is ready for use when it is dark brown, friable and has lost the smell 
of cowdung. 
 
Biodynamic Compost 
Heap  
Biodynamic compost is an effective soil conditioner and is an immediate source of 
nutrient for a crop.  Biodynamic Compost  Heap can be prepared by using green leaves 
(nitrogenous material)  and dry leaves (carbonaceous material) in 8-12 weeks.  
Integrating with cowdung slurry is always good in the decomposition process. The 
composition of air, moisture and warmth is very important in the breakdown and 
decomposition of material. The enrich compost is ready in 75-100 days depending upon the 
prevailing temperature. 
 
Steps in 
preparation  
! Five-meter long thick wood is placed on higher elevation where waterlogging does 
not occur during rainy  season.  
! Thick layer (20 cm) of dry grasses is spread on the area of 5 m x 2.5 m on the ground.  
! Water (100-150 litres) mixed with dung sprinkled on the grasses.  
! Again 20 cm thick layer of green grasses are sprayed equally on the heap and 100 to 
150 litres of water mixed with dung sprinkled on the heaps.  
! Above process (putting 20 cm thick layers of dry and green grasses alternatively) 
is repeated to the height of 1.5m.  
! For enriching the compost with different nutrients as per the need, rock phosphate 
(P), slacked lime (Ca) wood ash (K) etc. can also be used in between the layers of dry 
/ green grasses.  
! Two B.D sets (502-507) are incorporated and the heap is plastered with mixtures of 
dung and clay. 
       
422 
 
 
The BD compost is said to be more fertile with a stronger ability to improve soil than 
the conventional compost. When the specially prepared CPP and BD compost have been 
applied to the soil, the plants become more sensitive to their environment and responsive to 
the rhythms of the day, seasons and planets. 
 
Vermicomp
ost 
 
Vermiculture technology is an aspect involving the use of earthworms as versatile 
natural bioreactors for effective recycling of non-toxic organic wastes to the soil. They 
effectively harness the beneficial soil microflora, destroy soil pathogens, and covert 
organic wastes into valuable products  such as biofertilizers, biopesticides, vitamins, 
enzymes, antibiotics, growth hormones and proteinous biomass (5). 
 
Earthworms participate in soil farming system in following 
ways :  
! Through their influence on soil pH  
! As agents of physical decomposition of organic wastes  
! Promoting humus formation 
  
! Improving soil structure  
! Enriching soil and water-holding capacity. 
 
 
Steps in composting 
 
Vermicomposting on plane surface  
! Partially decomposed organic wastes are piled up on 2 m x 1 x 0.5 m areas at cool 
and elevated place.  
! Two to five thousand red worms (Eisenia foetida) are released in the middle of bed 
by putting 2-4 kg one week-old dung.  
! Water   (2-5 litres) is sprayed everyday to keep the earthworms active.   To 
protect earthworms from the excessive heat and rain, shade should be provided.  
! Depending upon the weather conditions complete heap of the organic waste get 
converted into fine compost within 75-120 days.  
! Ready compost is sieved to separate the earthworms.  
! Separated worms are released in another heap of partially decomposed organic 
waste.  
! As the time passes population of worms and vermicompost production increases 
very fast. 
 
Vermicomposting in pit  
! Brick structure (3 cm x 1.5 cm x 5 cm) is prepared in shade.  
! One brick wall made of cement is preferred.  
       
423 
 
! After putting 5 cm thick layer of concrete and sand, each 40 cm thick layer of 
partially decomposed or soften organic waste is spread equally above the sand.  
! One –week-old cowdung (1-2 kg) is kept at 6-8 places on the organic waste and 50-
100 earthworms are released in each heap of cowdung.  
! Water (2-5 litres) is sprayed in the bed and covered with 5 cm thick layer of organic 
waste.  
! The bed is covered with thatch to protect earthworms from excessive heat, rain and 
cold.  
! To keep the worms active, light spray of water is essential everyday.  
! Worms convert all the organic waste into compost. Again 30-40 cm thick layer of 
partially decomposed organic waste is spread equally in the bed and moistened and it 
takes another 
30-45 days for full conversion of organic waste into compost within 45-60 days.  
! Prepared compost is taken out and sieved to separate earthworms from the compost.  
! Pit is again filled up with organic waste and earthworms are released as discribed 
earlier.  
! As earthworm‘s population increases very fast, a few more pits are to be required 
to increase the verimicompost production. 
 
 
Vermiwash 
 
Vermiwash is prepared from the heavy population of earthworms reared in earthen pots 
or plastic drums. The extract contains major, micronutrients, vitamins (such as B 12) and 
hormones (gibberellins) secreted by the earthworms. Earthworms produce bacteriostatic 
substances and 
it was found the vermiwash can protect the bacterial infections.  Vermin wash can be 
sprayed on crops and trees for better growth, yield and quality. 
 
Steps in preparation  
! Bio earthen pot / plastic drum with capacity of 200 litres (provided with tap in the 
bottom) is placed in shade.  
! Five cm each of concrete and coarse red sand (Morang) is laid in the bottom of the pot 
for effective drainage.  
! Layer of soften kitchen waste or one-week-old dung (30-40cm) is filled in the pot.  
! Red worms (200-300) are released in the waste / dung.  
! An earthen pot with minute hole in the bottom from where water comes out in the form 
of drops is hanged over the pot / drum after 30 days of worms inoculation.  
! After 2-3 days, extract collected in earthen pots from the tap provided in the bottom of 
pot/ drum which is called ‗Vermiwash‘.  
! Extract diluted in the water (1:5 ratio) can be used as a foliar spray. 
 
Precaution : Continuous pouring of water in the pot / drum having hole in the bottom and 
the organic waste in the pot / drum should be changed regularly, after its full conversion 
into the compost.

Nadep Compost 
A farmer at Indore developed this method of aerobic composting.   Because of 
aerobic respiration, composting is very fast and nutritional status of the compost is better than 
the ordinary compost.  In this method of composting, farm wastes (cow-dung, green / dry 
grasses, wheat / paddy straw and weeds and garden soil) are used and the technique 
has been summarized below. The compost can be enriched through incorporation of rock 
phosphate, wood ash, slacked lime, Azotobacter and Rhizobium.  Incorporation of two BD 
sets (BD 502-507) further improves the nutritive status of NADEP compost, Thimmaiah 
(2001) named it as hybrid compost. 
 
Methods of composting  
! Brick aerobic structure (2m x 3.30m x 1m) is constructed at elevated place in farm 
area. First and the last two rows are provided without any gap to strengthen the structure.  
! Length of the structure can be altered as per the requirement  
! Thick layers (18-20 cm) of organic wastes are piled and water 100-150 litres mixed 
with cowdung is drenched on the waste. 
  
! Again 18-20 cm thick layer of organic waste pile, covered with thick layer (2-3cm) 
of garden soil is sprayed and sprinkled with water (100-150 litres).  
! The above processes are repeated till the piling goes 30-45 cm higher than the 
structure. 
Total heap is plastered with mixture of dung and mud.  
! After 10-15 days heap gets settled leaving 15-30 cm gaps from the top.  
! Process of filling and plastering are again repeated. 
   
Incorporation of any of these preparation and the following other associated activities will 
suffice the  nutritive requirement for production of horticultural crops, which can be 
summarized as below. 
 
In green food production nutritional requirement can be taken care through  
! Regular incorporation of organic waste through NADEP, Vermi, Biodynamic Compost 
(BD) or Microbe Mediated Compost (MM compost).  
! Use of cakes (neem, mahuwa, pongamia, castor, groundnut etc) as per availability 
need to be promoted.  
! Promotion of green manuring and legumes as inter and cover crops whenever and 
wherever possible.  
! Promotion of mulching with organic wastes which can be further promoted by spread of 
5-20 kg vermin / BD compost or 100g CPP and incorporation of 50-100 earthworms.  
! In order to encourage soil biological properties, regular use of Cow Pat Pit (CPP), 
Cow Horn Manure (BD -500) are also helpful. 
 
Need-based use of liquid manure prepared from cowdung, cow urine, leguminous leaves 
or vermin wash are also effective in promotion of growth and fruiting.

Wide variations in nutrient status of composts and CPP have been observed as evident 
from Table 6.   This can be further enriched through incorporation of rock phosphate, 
bone-meal, slacked lime,  blood  and fish meal.   Various combination of green vs dry 
leguminous non- leguminous may be helpful. These need to be worked out for meeting the 
nutritional requirement of various horticultural commodities. 
 
Biodynamic Tree Paste 
 
In a biodynamic process for the management of orchards and gardens, the ―biodynamic 
tree paste‖ is prepared by mixing of cowdung, bentonite (clay), BD 500 and sand. The tree 
paste is polished on the tree trunks and cut surfaces 
 
Nutrient status of compost and CPP 
 
Preparation N (%) P (%) K (%) 
General compost 0.3 - 0.5 0.20 - 0.35 0.50-1.50 
Vermi compost 1.12-1.75 0.214-0.285 0.506-1.72 
Cow Pat Pit 0.70-2.24 0.214-0.428 0.718-0.925 
Nadep compost 1.33-2.03 0.202-0.389 0.775-2.35 
 
The important properties of biodynamic tree paste are :  
! It nourishes, strengthens and protects the bark and cambium of tree to make it 
healthy.  
! Seals and heals wounds.  
! Helpful in prevention and control of disease.  
! On application after pruning, stimulates tree growth. 
 
 
In rejuvenation of mango orchard, copper oxychloride pasting (CoC) is very expensive. 
Pasting with the above paste on tree trunk and cut surfaces, alone has shown better 
response compared with CoC pasting.  Similar to tree paste, cowdung has been found to 
be rich in actionmycetes. Cowdung  paste and actionmycetes isolated from cow dung 
paste has also shown positive response in control of dieback, stem  end rot and 
anthracnose in mango and guava.  Similarl y, BD pesticides have shown effective control of 
bacterial fruit canker and tent caterpillar in mango. These need to be validated for control of 
pest and diseases of horticultural crops. 
Biodynamic system is almost new, but the preliminary observation over 4 years by the 
authors and  overvie w of world literatur e includin g persone l communication s have 
shown very encouraging response with number of horticultural and field crops and 
following interferences can be drawn at this juncture. 
If appears to be sustainable, economic and eco-friendly 
There is minimum risk of residual toxicity

There has been continuous improvement in soil fertility and produce quality including self-
life. Considering these experiences, following strategies are proposed to be initiated. 
Strategies for green food production 
! Various aspects of green food production particularly for horticultural commodities 
need to be standardized. 
! Promotion of establishment of demonstrations for preparation of biodynamic 
compost, cow  horn manure (BD0-500), horn silica (BD-501), Cow Pat Pit (CPP), 
liquid manures and liquid biodynamic pesticides. 
! Promotion for field demonstrations for organic biodynamic system of cultivation. 
! Organizing intensive training to farmers, NGO representative, entrepreneurs, and 
extension personnel of Department of Horticulture for biodynamic preparations and their 
applications. 
! Scientific explanation for responses of the above materials with reference to soil 
physical and microbiological properties and their impact. 
! Helping State Agriculture Universities (SAUs) to initiate a few courses on 
Organic / Biodynamic Agriculture. 
! Facilitation for certification / Demeter for organic /biodynamic production. 
! Establish national standards for covering marketing of certain agricultural products 
as green produced products. 
! Assure consumers that these meet a consistent standard. 
! Market promotion for ‗Green Food‘ and their processed products. 
! Regular monitoring of nutrients status of the soil. 
! Study on various combination of locally available waste recycling for meeting the 
nutrient requirement and techniques of compost enrichment. 
! Impact of organic / biodynamic farming on flora and fauna of the area. 
! Impact analysis of organic /biodynamic farming on agro-ecosystem of the region over 
the years.

HIGH DENSITY PLANTING IN FRUIT CROPS 
High density planting is the current concept by which productivity of the fruit crops can 
be enhanced per unit area . As most of the perennial fruit crops takes long years to attain a 
bigger canop y, it is possible to accommodate and maintain more trees per unit area till 
such canopy development interferes with general cultural operations or performance of the 
nearby plants by competing for light, water , nutrients and other inputs. High density planting 
of similar kind of fruit trees is also advantageous as it will not require much labour as 
required for intercropping with seasonal  crops to make use of the alley spaces available 
otherwise. The following are some of the advantages of high density planting. 
 The yield per unit area could be increased. 
 Reduced labour cost and labour involvement towards weeding and desuckering. 
 Efficient utilization of land, water, fertilizer and solar radiation. 
 Cost of production per unit quantity of fruits could be reduced considerably. 
The methods by which, the HDP can be practiced in different fruit crops are mentioned 
briefly below. 
 
Mango 
Mangoes can be planted at a spacing of 5m x 5m and maintained till such time canopy 
overlapping is noted. The alternate rows can be removed if necessary at later stage 
when canopy  overlapping interferes with the normal gowth and performance of the 
plants or with cultural  operations. Mangoes can be also maintained  at HDP system by 
proper   pruning and regulating the canopy. Dwarf statured varieties with narrow canopy are 
much suitable for HDP system. Experiments  with mango varieties like Amrapali, 
Dashehari and Mallika in Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi have indicated 
that even a spacing of 2.5-3m either way  can be maintained in the initial years 
accommodating nearly 1300 plants per ha. 
 
Sapota 
Similar to mango, sapota is usually planted at 8-9m spacing conventionally. However, it is 
advisable to use a spacing of 5-6 m either way under HDP as it takes many years for the 
plants to assume the full canopy coverage. The recently released varieties like CO 3 sapota 
and PKM 4 sapota can be planted under HDP owing to their upright growth habit.

Banana 
Banana is grown normally at a spacing of 1.8 x 1.8 m (6‘ x 6‘) by planting one sucker per 
pit, in India.  A new concept of increasing the plant density by planting more number of 
suckers per pit at a wider spacing has proved successful in increasing the productivity of 
banana. This system of  high density planting in banana was devised at Horticultural 
College and Research Institute, Coimbatore  and has proved efficient in increasing the 
productivity of banana. Interestingly, it has  also showed thet possibility of reducing the 
water and fertilizer to a tune of 30-40% without affecting the yield. 
 
Based on a series of research trials  on HDP on banana  taken up in the Department of 
Fruit crops,   TNAU, Coimbatore it is recommended that HDP can be acheived by 
planting three suckers / hill  at a spacing of 1.8 x 3.6 m  ( 4629 plants/ha). On per plant 
basis, instead of full dosage  of fertilizer (i.e. 110: 35 : 330 g of NPK ) only 75 % of the 
fertilizer needs to be applied. By this method, 25-40 % enhanced yield can be obtained from 
an unit area. Though a slight reduction in individual bunch weight was observed when 
compared to conventional planting, the bunch grade was found to be similar indicating no 
difference in the market appeal of the bunch/hands. 
 
Pineapple 
It is possible to accomodate 43,000-50,000 plants per ha in pineapple by planting in 
double rows either in beds or in trenches with the plants into the second rows set in the 
middle of the plants in the first row. The spacing between two trenches will be 90 cm. Row 
to row spacing in the same bed per trench can be 45- 60 cm and plant spacing within the 
row is 30 cm. 
 
HDP systems are not without disadvantages. Some disadvantages of high density planting 
are high  initial capital investment, extended  cropping cycle in herbaceous crops like 
banana or pineapple  and occasionally quick spread of pest and diseases. But if 
managed properly, the HDP  system will prove to be economically advantageous to the 
grower in the long run.
