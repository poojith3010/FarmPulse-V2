NUTRIENTS - FUNCTIONS AND DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS \nThe effect of major nutrients  on growth  and yield of oil palm has been studied \n \nin most of the  oil palm growing countries in Asia and Africa. a) Nitrogen: In oil palm, characteristic yellowing symptoms are developed under \nN deficiency conditions.

Nitrogen is found to be essential for rapid growth and fruiting \nof the palm. It increases  the leaf producti on rate, leaf area, net assimilation rate, \nnumber of bunches and bunch weight. Excessive application of nitrogen increases the \nproduction of male inflorescence and decrea ses female inflorescence thereby reducing \nthe sex ratio. b) Phosphorus: In oil palm seedlings, P defi ciency causes the older  leaves  to \nbecome  dull  and assume a pale olive green colour while in adult palms high incidence \nof premature desiccation of older leaves occurs.", "Excessive application of nitrogen increases the \nproduction of male inflorescence and decrea ses female inflorescence thereby reducing \nthe sex ratio. b) Phosphorus: In oil palm seedlings, P defi ciency causes the older  leaves  to \nbecome  dull  and assume a pale olive green colour while in adult palms high incidence \nof premature desiccation of older leaves occurs.

Under severe deficiency, \nthe  mature  leaves  become  chlorotic and necrotic. Confluent orange spotting is the  \nmain  K deficiency  condition  in  oil palm in which chlorotic spots, changing from pale \ngreen through yellow to  orange,  develop  and  enlarge both between and across the \nleaflet, veins and fuse to form compound lesi ons of a  bright orange colour.", "Under severe deficiency, \nthe  mature  leaves  become  chlorotic and necrotic.

Necrosis \nwithin spots is common, but irregular. Mid crown yellowing is  another  prominent K \ndeficiency condition of the palm in which le aves around the 10th  position  on  the  \nphyllotaxy become pale in co lour followed by terminal  and marginal  necrosis.

There is little doubt that with \nthe progressive modernisation of Indian Agriculture involving intensive inputs, herbicide \nuse will steadily gain an importance in the coming years. In the recent decades, the growth \nof herbicides took place principally at the expense of fungicides, which declined from a \nmarket share of 40 per cent in 1960 to 25 per cent in 1995. About 72 per cent of the \nherbicide consumption out of the total took place in the developed countries, viz. , USA, \nWestern Europe and Japan.", "About 72 per cent of the \nherbicide consumption out of the total took place in the developed countries, viz. , USA, \nWestern Europe and Japan. As against the growth of 2. 5 per cent for insecticides and 3. 3 \nper cent for fungicides, the herbicides grew at the rate of 5.", "5 per cent for insecticides and 3. 3 \nper cent for fungicides, the herbicides grew at the rate of 5. 0 per cent per annum. In India, commercial use of herbicides came in 1980. During this period, the herbicides \nregistered a significant growth than insecticides and fungicides.", "In India, commercial use of herbicides came in 1980. During this period, the herbicides \nregistered a significant growth than insecticides and fungicides. From a megre 2 per cent \nshare of the total pesticide consumption in the seventies in India, herbicides now account \nfor about 11 per cent of the pesticides market. While this is a very encouraging \ndevelopment, the herbicide consumption in our country is still much less than that in \ndeveloped countries, where herbicides constitute 40 -50 per cent of the total pesticide \nconsumption. Conjunctive use approach: \nThere are several advantages of using soil applied herbicides in conjuction with \nfertilizers.", "While this is a very encouraging \ndevelopment, the herbicide consumption in our country is still much less than that in \ndeveloped countries, where herbicides constitute 40 -50 per cent of the total pesticide \nconsumption. Conjunctive use approach: \nThere are several advantages of using soil applied herbicides in conjuction with \nfertilizers. Trials on impregnated of fertilizers with herbicides have been highly successful \nand fertilizers impregnated with several herbicides are now commercially available in \nUSA.

[ \n \nSystem approach: \nIntegrated weed management (IWM) practices for individual crops have been developed \nby several workers.

The IWM system also includes the use of judicious irrigation \npractices, timely and appropriate cultivation, sound crop rotation, crop diversification, \nfield sanitation and harvesting methods that do not spread weed seeds, use of \nbiological agents and effective chemical methods. However, the crop- weed \ninteraction s are  comple x and needs applicatio n of recent advancement s for the \ndevelopment of future weed management strategies. 358 \n \nCrop-weed competition \n \nExperimental results have shown that crop-weed competition at critical stages of crop life \nhas reduced the yields in several crops.", "However, the crop- weed \ninteraction s are  comple x and needs applicatio n of recent advancement s for the \ndevelopment of future weed management strategies. 358 \n \nCrop-weed competition \n \nExperimental results have shown that crop-weed competition at critical stages of crop life \nhas reduced the yields in several crops.
